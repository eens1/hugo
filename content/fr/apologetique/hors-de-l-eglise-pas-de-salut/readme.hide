1. Matthew 16:18-19

    "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage is foundational for the Catholic understanding of the Church. Catholics believe that Jesus established the Church on Peter, making it the primary means through which God's grace is dispensed to the world. The Church, under the leadership of the Pope (successor of Peter), is therefore seen as necessary for salvation because it holds the "keys to the kingdom."
2. John 3:5

    "Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.'"

Catholic Interpretation: This verse is understood as a reference to the necessity of baptism for salvation. Since baptism is normally administered within the context of the Church, this is seen as further evidence that the Church is necessary for salvation.
3. Ephesians 5:23

    "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is described as the "Body of Christ," with Christ as its Savior. This suggests that those who are members of the Church are part of Christ's body and, therefore, in the place of salvation. Being outside the Church, then, would imply being outside of this saving relationship.
4. 1 Timothy 3:15

    "If I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is described as the "pillar and foundation of the truth," suggesting that it is the primary means through which truth and, by extension, salvation is made known to humanity. Without the Church, one would not have access to this truth.
5. Acts 4:12

    "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."


6. John 10:16

    "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse is understood to reflect Jesus' desire for unity under one shepherd. The "one flock" is often interpreted as the Church, with the Pope as the shepherd representing Christ on earth. The verse suggests that all believers are called to be part of this one unified Church for the fullness of salvation.
7. John 15:5-6

    "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me, you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned."

Catholic Interpretation: The Catholic Church views itself as the Body of Christ, and this passage emphasizes the necessity of remaining connected to Christ (the vine) through the Church (the branches). Those who are not connected to this vine, symbolizing the Church, are in danger of spiritual death.
8. Matthew 18:17

    "If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse highlights the authority of the Church in matters of faith and discipline. The implication is that being outside the Church is akin to being an outsider (a "pagan" or "tax collector"), which in a spiritual sense would mean being outside the realm of salvation.
9. 1 Corinthians 12:12-13

    "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage describes the Church as the Body of Christ, with all members (those baptized) being part of that body. Being outside this body, in the Catholic view, would mean being outside the community that is united in Christ and through which salvation is realized.
10. Luke 10:16

    "Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."

Catholic Interpretation: Jesus is speaking to His apostles, who are seen as the first leaders of the Church. This verse is interpreted to mean that rejecting the authority of the Church is equivalent to rejecting Christ Himself, which implies that salvation cannot be fully attained outside the Church.
11. Hebrews 13:17

    "Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage underscores the importance of obedience to Church authority, which is believed to be divinely instituted. Disobedience or separation from the Church's authority is seen as jeopardizing one's spiritual well-being and, by extension, one's salvation.



Certainly! Here are more Bible verses that have been interpreted within the Catholic tradition to support the importance of the Church for salvation:
12. Romans 10:14-15

    "How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!'"

Catholic Interpretation: This passage emphasizes the necessity of preaching for the spread of the Gospel and the salvation of souls. The Catholic Church views itself as the divinely established institution through which this preaching occurs. The idea is that the Church is essential for making Christ known to the world, and thus necessary for salvation.
13. Matthew 28:19-20

    "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

Catholic Interpretation: This Great Commission given by Jesus to His apostles is seen as the foundation for the Church’s mission. The command to "make disciples" and "baptize" is understood as establishing the Church as the necessary means for bringing people to salvation. The Church’s mission to evangelize and baptize is therefore central to its role in God’s plan for salvation.
14. 1 Peter 3:20-21

    "...to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ..."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage draws a parallel between the salvation of Noah’s family through the ark and the salvation of Christians through baptism, which is typically administered by the Church. Just as the ark was necessary for salvation from the flood, so is the Church seen as necessary for salvation through baptism.
15. Colossians 1:18

    "And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy."

Catholic Interpretation: Here, Christ is described as the head of the Church, which is His body. This emphasizes the intimate connection between Christ and the Church. The implication is that being part of the Church, which is Christ's body, is necessary to be in communion with Christ and thus to attain salvation.
16. Acts 2:47

    "And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse speaks of the early Christian community, which is the Church, and how God was adding those who were being saved to it. This suggests that salvation and membership in the Church are closely linked, as those who are saved are incorporated into the Church.
17. 1 Corinthians 1:10

    "I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse calls for unity within the Christian community, which the Catholic Church interprets as a mandate for ecclesial unity under the authority of the Church. Division from the Church, therefore, is seen as endangering one's relationship with Christ and, consequently, one's salvation.
18. Galatians 1:8-9

    "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!"

Catholic Interpretation: This passage emphasizes the importance of adhering to the true Gospel, which the Catholic Church believes it faithfully preserves and teaches. Departing from this true teaching, as the Church understands it, puts one’s salvation at risk.


Certainly! Here are additional Bible verses that have been interpreted by the Catholic Church to support the idea that the Church plays a central role in the plan of salvation:
19. John 6:53-54

    "Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.'"

Catholic Interpretation: This passage is central to the Catholic understanding of the Eucharist, which is administered within the Church. The Church teaches that the Eucharist is a source of grace and necessary for eternal life, as it directly connects believers with the sacrifice of Christ.
20. 1 Corinthians 11:27-29

    "So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage emphasizes the sacredness of the Eucharist and the need to partake of it worthily, which presupposes participation in the sacramental life of the Church. The Church is seen as the guardian of the sacraments, making it essential for the proper administration and reception of these means of grace.
21. Revelation 22:17

    "The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!' And let the one who hears say, 'Come!' Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life."

Catholic Interpretation: The "bride" is interpreted as the Church, which calls all people to come and receive the "water of life," symbolic of salvation. The Church, as the bride of Christ, is seen as the mediator of this invitation to salvation.
22. Ephesians 2:19-20

    "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage describes the Church as God’s household, built on the foundation of the apostles, with Christ as the cornerstone. Being part of this household (the Church) is seen as essential to being in communion with Christ and receiving salvation.
23. Ephesians 4:4-6

    "There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."

Catholic Interpretation: The "one body" refers to the Church, which is seen as the singular, unified body of Christ. This passage supports the idea that there is one true faith and one baptism, all of which are found within the Catholic Church, making it essential for salvation.
24. Acts 20:28

    "Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse highlights the role of Church leaders (bishops and priests) as shepherds of the Church, which is purchased by Christ's blood. The Church is seen as the precious and necessary means through which Christ’s salvation is applied to the faithful.
25. Hebrews 10:25

    "Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse emphasizes the importance of communal worship and gathering as the Church. The Catholic Church sees itself as the community in which believers are to gather to worship God and receive the sacraments, which are seen as necessary for salvation.
26. 2 Thessalonians 2:15

    "So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse stresses the importance of holding onto the teachings passed down by the apostles, which the Catholic Church believes it faithfully preserves and teaches. This continuity of apostolic teaching is seen as essential for maintaining the true faith and, therefore, for salvation.

27. 1 Timothy 2:3-4

    "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church sees itself as the custodian of the "knowledge of the truth," which leads to salvation. As the Church proclaims the truth revealed by God, it plays a central role in leading people to salvation.

28. Mark 16:16

    "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."

Catholic Interpretation: Baptism is typically administered within the Church, making the Church essential for receiving this sacrament. The verse underscores the necessity of belief and baptism, both of which are closely tied to the Church's mission.


29. John 17:20-21

    "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me."

Catholic Interpretation: Jesus prays for unity among His followers, which the Catholic Church interprets as a call for unity in one Church. The unity of believers is seen as a sign to the world, and this unity is believed to be fully realized in the Catholic Church. Being part of this unified body is considered necessary for participating fully in the salvation Christ offers.
30. Titus 3:5

    "He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit."

Catholic Interpretation: The "washing of rebirth" is understood as a reference to baptism, a sacrament administered by the Church. Since baptism is necessary for salvation, and the Church is the ordinary means of administering this sacrament, this verse supports the Church’s role in the salvation process.
31. James 5:14-15

    "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage refers to the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, which the Church administers. The Church sees this as an example of how it serves as a means of dispensing God’s grace, including the forgiveness of sins, which is essential for salvation.
32. Matthew 7:21

    "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."

Catholic Interpretation: The Catholic Church teaches that doing the will of the Father includes being part of the Church Christ established and living according to its teachings. Therefore, participation in the life of the Church is seen as a key aspect of doing God’s will and thus entering the kingdom of heaven.
33. Matthew 13:47-50

    "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

Catholic Interpretation: The net is often interpreted as the Church, which gathers people of all kinds. At the end of time, a separation will occur between the righteous and the wicked. The Church is seen as the means through which people are gathered and brought to salvation, with a warning of the consequences of being found outside of God’s grace.
34. Luke 10:16

    "Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."

Catholic Interpretation: Jesus is speaking to His apostles, who are the first leaders of the Church. This verse underscores the authority given to the Church’s leaders and the importance of adhering to their teachings. Rejecting the Church’s authority is equated with rejecting Christ Himself, which is seen as endangering one’s salvation.
35. 2 Timothy 2:19

    "Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and, 'Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.'"

Catholic Interpretation: The "solid foundation" is often interpreted as the Church, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the cornerstone. Belonging to this foundation—being part of the Church—is associated with turning away from wickedness and being known by the Lord, which is essential for salvation.
36. Romans 12:4-5

    "For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage emphasizes the unity and diversity of the Church as the Body of Christ. Every member is connected to the body, and being a part of this body (the Church) is essential for spiritual health and salvation. The Church sees itself as the context in which this unity in diversity is realized.
37. Hebrews 13:7

    "Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith."

Catholic Interpretation: The Catholic Church teaches that its bishops and priests are the successors of the apostles and are to be respected and followed. This verse underscores the importance of adhering to the teachings of Church leaders as a way to ensure fidelity to the true faith, which is crucial for salvation.
38. 1 John 2:19

    "They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse is often used to highlight the importance of remaining within the Church. Those who leave the Church are seen as separating themselves from the community of believers, which, according to Catholic teaching, puts their salvation at risk.
39. Acts 2:41-42

    "Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage describes the early Church’s communal life, centered on the apostles’ teaching, fellowship, and the breaking of bread (understood as the Eucharist). The Catholic Church sees this as a model for its own life and mission, with participation in this community being necessary for spiritual nourishment and salvation.
40. 2 Corinthians 5:18-20

    "All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God."

Catholic Interpretation: The "ministry of reconciliation" is understood as the sacrament of Confession, which the Church administers. The Church sees itself as Christ’s ambassador, entrusted with the message and means of reconciliation with God. Therefore, the Church’s role in this ministry is essential for the forgiveness of sins and salvation.



41. John 15:4-6

    "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned."

Catholic Interpretation: In this passage, Jesus describes Himself as the vine and His followers as the branches. The Catholic Church interprets this to mean that being connected to Christ through the Church (the visible Body of Christ on earth) is necessary for spiritual life and salvation. Apart from this connection, one cannot bear fruit and risks being cast away.
42. Philippians 3:20-21

    "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is seen as the earthly expression of this heavenly citizenship, guiding believers towards their eternal home. By being part of the Church, Catholics believe they are on the path to receiving the transformation and salvation that Christ offers.
43. Acts 4:32-33

    "All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage emphasizes the unity and communal life of the early Church, led by the apostles. The Catholic Church sees itself as the continuation of this apostolic community, where believers are united in faith and charity. This unity is considered essential for participating fully in the life of grace and salvation.
44. 1 Corinthians 12:12-13

    "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is often referred to as the "Body of Christ." This passage highlights the unity of believers as members of this body through baptism, which is administered by the Church. Being part of this body is seen as necessary for living in the Spirit and for salvation.
45. Matthew 16:27-28

    "For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church sees itself as the visible manifestation of Christ’s kingdom on earth, where the faithful are called to live according to God’s will in anticipation of the final judgment. Participation in the Church is viewed as essential for receiving the rewards of eternal life.
46. 2 Peter 1:20-21

    "Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage underscores the Church’s role in the correct interpretation of Scripture. The Catholic Church believes it has been given the authority, through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to authentically interpret and teach Scripture, which is crucial for knowing the truth and attaining salvation.

Catholic Interpretation: This passage speaks to the role of Church leaders as shepherds of God’s flock. The Catholic Church sees this as a mandate for the ordained ministry (bishops, priests) to guide and care for the faithful, which is essential for the spiritual well-being and salvation of the believers.
49. Romans 1:16

    "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is the custodian and proclaimer of the Gospel, through which salvation is made known to the world. This verse emphasizes the power of the Gospel, which the Church believes it faithfully preserves and preaches for the salvation of all who believe.

    "Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."

Catholic Interpretation: This verse directly refers to the Church as the "pillar and foundation of the truth." The Catholic Church interprets this as affirming its role as the guardian of divine truth and the necessary guide for believers to live according to God’s will, which is essential for salvation.


51. 1 Corinthians 3:11

    "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church teaches that Christ is the foundation, and the Church is built upon Him, with the apostles as the first leaders. Since the Church is built on this unshakeable foundation, it is viewed as the necessary structure through which believers are united with Christ and find salvation.
52. Matthew 28:18-20

    "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'"

Catholic Interpretation: This is known as the Great Commission, where Jesus commands His apostles to make disciples of all nations. The Catholic Church sees this as the mission entrusted to it by Christ Himself, with the authority to teach, baptize, and guide believers to salvation.
53. 2 Timothy 4:1-2

    "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction."

And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!'"

Catholic Interpretation: The Church interprets this passage as emphasizing the necessity of apostolic preaching for the spread of the Gospel and the salvation of souls. The Church sees itself as the institution that continues this mission of preaching and teaching, without which people cannot come to faith and be saved.
56. Galatians 4:26

    "But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church is often symbolically referred to as "our mother," particularly in this verse. The Catholic Church sees itself as the spiritual mother of all believers, nourishing them with the sacraments and guiding them to salvation.
57. John 20:21-23

    "Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.' And with that he breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.'"

Catholic Interpretation: This passage is foundational for the Church’s teaching on the sacrament of Confession (Reconciliation). The Church interprets this as giving the apostles and their successors the authority to forgive sins, which is necessary for reconciliation with God and salvation.
58. Ephesians 1:22-23

    "And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way."

Catholic Interpretation: The "house of God" refers to the Church, and the "great priest" is Jesus Christ. The Catholic Church sees itself as the community where believers are cleansed and can draw near to God through the sacraments, which are necessary for salvation.
60. Matthew 25:31-46 (The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats)

    "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage teaches that Christ will judge all people based on their actions, particularly their treatment of others.

61. Luke 22:19-20

    "And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.'"

Catholic Interpretation: This passage is central to the institution of the Eucharist, which the Catholic Church teaches is necessary for spiritual nourishment and salvation. The Church believes that Christ instituted the Eucharist to be perpetuated within the Church, making the Church essential for participating in this sacrament.
62. 1 Peter 2:9-10

    "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."

Catholic Interpretation: The Church interprets this as describing the Christian community, which is the Church. Believers are called to be part of this holy nation, the Church, through which they receive God’s mercy and salvation.
63. Acts 9:4-5

    "He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' 'Who are you, Lord?' Saul asked. 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' he replied."

Catholic Interpretation: Jesus identifies Himself with the Church, indicating that persecution of the Church is persecution of Christ Himself. The Church interprets this as emphasizing the close union between Christ and His Church, suggesting that to be separated from the Church is to be separated from Christ, which endangers one’s salvation.
64. Ephesians 2:19-22

    "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit."

Catholic Interpretation: This passage describes the Church as a spiritual household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the cornerstone. The Church sees itself as this holy temple, essential for believers to be part of in order to be indwelt by God’s Spirit and saved.
65. Revelation 12:17

    "Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus."

Catholic Interpretation: The woman is often interpreted as representing both Mary and the Church. The Church is seen as the community of those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus, which is necessary for resisting the forces of evil and attaining salvation.
