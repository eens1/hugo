1 A gradual canticle. Behold now bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord: Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.

2 In the nights lift up your hands to the holy places, and bless ye the Lord.

3 May the Lord out of Sion bless thee, he that made heaven and earth.
