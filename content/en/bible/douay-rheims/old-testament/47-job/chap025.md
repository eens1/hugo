1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:

2 Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places.

3 Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?

4 Can man be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a woman appear clean?

5 Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight.

6 How much more is man than rottenness and the son of man than a worm?
