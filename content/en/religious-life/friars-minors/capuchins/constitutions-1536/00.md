In the name of Our Lord Jesus-Christ begin the Constitutions of the Friar Minor Capuchins.

To the end that our order, as the Vineyard of the Most High Son of God, may the better stand fast in the spiritual observance of the Evangelical and Seraphic Rule, the General Chapter held at Rome in our monastery of St Euphemia, the year of the Lord 1536, deemed it advisable to draw up certain statutes which might serve as a fence for our Holy Rule, in order that, like the unconquerable tower of David, it might have a means of protection from whatever might injure the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, and keep out all relaxations opposed to the fervent and seraphic zeal bequeathed to us by our Father St Francis.
