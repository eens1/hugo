  Of the Divine Office and of the Fast.
---


The Lord says: "This kind [of devil] can go out by nothing but by fasting and prayer"; and again: "When you fast be not as the hypocrites, sad." For this reason let all the brothers, whether clerics or laics, say the Divine Office, the praises and prayers which they ought to say. The clerics shall say the Office, and say it for the living and the dead, according to the custom of clerics; but to satisfy for the defect and negligence of the brothers, let them say every day *Miserere mei*, with the *Pater noster*; for the deceased brothers let them say *De profundis*, with *Pater noster*. 

And they may have only the books necessary to perform their Office; and the lay-brothers who know how to read the Psalter may also have one; but the others who do not know how to read may not have a book. The lay-brothers however shall say: *Credo in Deum*, and twenty-four *Paternosters* with *Gloria Patri* for Matins, but for Lauds, five; for Prime, Tierce, Sext, and Nones, for each, seven *Paternosters* with *Gloria Patri*; for Vespers, twelve; for Compline, *Credo in Deum* and seven *Paternosters* with *Gloria Patri*; for the dead, seven *Paternosters* with *Requiem aeternam*, and for the defect and negligence of the brothers, three *Paternosters* every day.

And all the brothers shall likewise fast from the feast of All Saints until the Nativity of our Lord, and from Epiphany, when our Lord Jesus Christ began to fast, until Easter; but at other times let them not be bound to fast according to this life except on Fridays. And they may eat of all foods which are placed before them, according to the Gospel.
