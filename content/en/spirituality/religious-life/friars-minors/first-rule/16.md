  Of those who go among the Saracens and other Infidels.
---


The Lord says: "Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves." Wherefore, whoever of the brothers may wish, by divine inspiration, to go among the Saracens and other infidels, let them go with the permission of their minister and servant. But let the minister give them leave and not refuse them, if he sees they are fit to be sent; he will be held to render an account to the Lord if in this or in other things he acts indiscreetly.

The brothers, however, who go may conduct themselves in two ways spiritually among them. One way is not to make disputes or contentions; but let them be "subject to every human creature for God’s sake," yet confessing themselves to be Christians. The other way is that when they see it is pleasing to God, they announce the Word of God, that they may believe in Almighty God, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, the Creater of all, our Lord the Redeemer and Saviour the Son, and that they should be baptized and be made Christians, because, "unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."

These and other things which please God they may say to them, for the Lord says in the Gospel: "Everyone that shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven;" and "he that shall be ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man shall be ashamed, when He shall comein His majesty and that of His Father, and of the holy angels."

And let all the brothers, wherever they may be, remember that they have given themselves, and have relinquished their bodies to our Lord Jesus Christ; and for love of Him they ought to expose themselves to enemies both visible and invisible, for the Lord says: "Whosoever shall lose his life for My sake, shall save it" in eternal life. "Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice" sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you." If however they should persecute you in one city, flee to another. "Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against you, untruly, for My sake." "Be glad in that day and rejoice, for your reward is great in heaven." "I say to you, my friends, be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." "See that ye are not troubled."" ‘In your patience you shall possess your souls." "But he that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved."
