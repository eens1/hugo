  Of the Confession of the Brothers and of the Reception of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
---


Let my blessed brothers, both clerics and laics, confess their sins to priests of our religion. And if they cannot do this, let them confess to other discreet and Catholic priests, knowing firmly and hoping that from whatever Catholic priests they may receive penance and absolution, they will undoubtedly be absolved from these sins if they take care to observe humbly and faithfully the penance enjoined them. 

If however they cannot then have a priest, let them confess to their brother, as the Apostle James says: "Confess your sins to one another;" but let them not on this account fail to have recourse to priests, for to priests alone the power of binding and loosing has been given. 

And thus contrite and having confessed, let them receive the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ with great humility and veneration, calling to mind what the Lord Himself says: "He that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood hath everlasting life;" and "Do this for a commemoration of Me."
