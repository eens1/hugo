<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>Let the brothers in whatever places they may be among others to serve or to work, not be chamberlains, nor cellarers, nor overseers in the houses of those whom they serve, and let them not accept any employment which might cause scandal, or be injurious to their soul, but let them be inferior and subject to all who are in the same house.</p>
<p>And let the brothers who know how to work, labor and exercise themselves in that art they may understand, if it be not contrary to the salvation of their soul, and they can exercise it becomingly. For the prophet says: &ldquo;For thou shalt eat the labors of thy hands; blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee&rdquo;; and the Apostle: &ldquo;If any man will not work, neither let him eat.&rdquo; And let every man abide in the art or employment wherein he was called.</p>
<p>And for their labor they may receive all necessary things, except money. And if they be in want, let them seek for alms like other brothers. And they may have the tools and implements necessary for their work. Let all the brothers apply themselves with diligence to good works, for it is written: &ldquo;Be always busy in some good work, that the devil may find thee occupied;&rdquo; and again: &ldquo;Idleness is an enemy to the soul.&rdquo; Therefore the servants of God ought always to continue in prayer or in some other good work.</p>
<p>Let the brothers take care that wherever they may be, whether in hermitages or in other places, they never appropriate any place to themselves, or maintain it against another. And whoever may come to them, either a friend or a foe, a thief or a robber, let them receive him kindly. And wherever the brothers are and in whatsoever place they may find themselves, let them spiritually and diligently show reverence and honor toward one another without murmuring. And let them take care not to appear exteriorly sad and gloomy like hypocrites, but let them show themselves to be joyful and contented in the Lord, merry and becomingly courteous.</p>
