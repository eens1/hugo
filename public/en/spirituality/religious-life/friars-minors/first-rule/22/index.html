<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>Let us all, brothers, give heed to what the Lord says : &ldquo;Love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you.&rdquo; For our Lord Jesus, whose footsteps we ought to follow, called His betrayer friend, and offered Himself willingly to His crucifiers. Therefore all those who unjustly inflict upon us tribulations and anguishes, shames and injuries, sorrows and torments, martyrdom and death, are our friends whom we ought to love much, because we gain eternal life by that which they make us suffer.</p>
<p>And let us hate our body with its vices and sins, because by living carnally it wishes to deprive us of the love of our Lord Jesus Christ and eternal life, and to lose itself with all else in hell; for we by our own fault are corrupt, miserable, and averse to good, but prompt and willing to evil; because, as the Lord says in the Gospel: from the heart of men proceed and come evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, false testimonies, blasphemy, foolishness. All these evils come from within, from the heart of man, and these are what defile a man.</p>
<p>But now, after having renounced the world, we have nothing else to do but to be solicitous, to follow the will of God, and to please Him.</p>
<p>Let us take much care that we be not the wayside, or the stony or thorny ground, according to what the Lord says in the Gospel: The seed is the word of God. And that which fell by the wayside and was trampled under foot are they that hear the word and do not understand; then the devil cometh, and snatcheth that which has been sown in their hearts and taketh the word out of their hearts, lest believing they should be saved.</p>
<p>But that which fell upon the rock are they who, when they hear the word, at once receive it with joy; but when tribulation and persecution arise on account of the word, they are immediately scandalized, and these have no roots in themselves, but are for a while, for they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.</p>
<p>But that which fell among thorns are they who hear the word of God, and the solicitude and cares of this world, the fallacies of riches, and the desire of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</p>
<p>But that sown on good ground are they who, in a good and best heart, hearing the word understand and keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience.</p>
<p>And for this reason, brothers, let us, as the Lord says, &ldquo;let the dead bury their dead.&rdquo;  And let us be much on our guard against the malice and cunning of Satan, who desires that man should not give his heart and mind to the Lord God, and who going about seeks to seduce the heart of man under pretext of some reward or benefit, to smother the words and precepts of the Lord from memory, and who wishes to blind the heart of man by wordly business and cares, and to dwell there, as the Lord says: &ldquo;When an unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none; then he saith: &lsquo;I will return into my house whence I came out.&rsquo; And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is made worse than the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherefore let us all, brothers, watch much, lest under pretext of some reward or labor or aid we lose or separate our mind and heart from the Lord. But I beseech all the brothers, both the ministers and others, in the charity which God is, that, overcoming all obstacles and putting aside all care and solicitude, they strive in the best manner they are able, to serve, love, and honor the Lord God with a clean heart and a pure mind, which He seeks above all. And let us always make in us a tabernacle and dwelling-place for Him, who is the Lord God Omnipotent, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, who says: &ldquo;Watch, therefore, praying at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape&rdquo; all the evils &ldquo;that are to come, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when you stand to pray, say, &ldquo;Our Father, who art in heaven.&rdquo; And let us adore Him with a pure heart, for &ldquo;we ought always to pray, and not to faint,&rdquo; for the Father seeks such adorers. &ldquo;God is a Spirit, and they that adore Him, must adore Him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo; And let us have recourse to Him as the &ldquo;Shepherd and Bishop of our souls,&rdquo; who says: &ldquo;I am the Good Shepherd,&rdquo; who feed My sheep, &ldquo;and I lay down My life for My flock.&rdquo; But all you are brothers. &ldquo;And call none your father upon earth; for one is your Father who is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters, for one is your master, who is in heaven, Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered together in My Name, there am I in the midst of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us therefore hold fast the words, the life and doctrine and holy Gospel of Him who deigned for us to ask His Father to manifest to us His Name, saying: Father, I have manifested Thy Name to the men whom Thou hast given Me because the words which Thou gavest Me I have given to them, and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came forth out of Thee, and they have believed that Thou didst send Me. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them whom Thou hast given Me, because they are Thine and all My things are Thine. Holy Father, keep them in Thy Name whom Thou hast given Me, that they may be one, as We also are. These things I speak in the world that they may have joy filled in themselves. I have given them Thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I also am not of the world. I pray not that Thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldst keep them from evil. Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth. As Thou hast sent Me into the world, I have sent them into the world. And forthem I do sanctify Myself, that they may be sanctified in truth. Not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in Me, that they may be consummated in one, and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast also loved Me. And I have made known Thy Name to them, that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them. Father, I will that where I am, they also whom Thou hast given Me may be with Me, that they may sce Thy glory in Thy kingdom.</p>
