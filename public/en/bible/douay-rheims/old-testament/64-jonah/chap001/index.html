<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>1 Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amathi, saying:</p>
<p>2 Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it: For the wickedness thereof is come up before me.</p>
<p>3 And Jonah rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord,</p>
<p>4 But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.</p>
<p>5 And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jonah went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>6 And the ship master came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us that we may not perish.</p>
<p>7 And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</p>
<p>8 And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?</p>
<p>9 And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.</p>
<p>10 And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)</p>
<p>11 And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.</p>
<p>12 And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</p>
<p>13 And the men rowed hard to return the land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.</p>
<p>14 And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord let us not perish for this man&rsquo;s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, oh Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.</p>
<p>15 And they took Jonah, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.</p>
<p>16 And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to the Lord, and made vows.</p>
