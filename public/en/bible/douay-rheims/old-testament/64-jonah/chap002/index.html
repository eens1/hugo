<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah: and Jonah was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.</p>
<p>2 And Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the fish.</p>
<p>3 And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</p>
<p>4 And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.</p>
<p>5 And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see the holy temple again.</p>
<p>6 The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.</p>
<p>7 I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Lord, my God.</p>
<p>8 When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.</p>
<p>9 They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p>10 But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.</p>
<p>11 And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
