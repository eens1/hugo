<h1>Chapter 64</h1>

<p>1 O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and wouldst come down: the mountains would melt away at thy presence.</p>
<p>2 They would melt as at the burning of fire, the waters would burn with fire, that thy name might be made known to thy enemies: that the nations might tremble at thy presence.</p>
<p>3 When thou shalt do wonderful things, we shall not bear them: thou didst come down, and at thy presence the mountains melted away.</p>
<p>4 From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears: the eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.</p>
<p>5 Thou hast met him that rejoiceth, and doth justice: in thy ways they shall remember thee: behold thou art angry, and we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>6 And we are all become as one unclean, and all our justices as the rag of a menstruous woman: and we have all fallen as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>
<p>7 There is none that calleth upon thy name: that riseth up, and taketh hold of thee: thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast crushed us in the hand of our iniquity.</p>
<p>8 And now, O Lord, thou art our father, and we are clay: and thou art our maker, and we all are the works of thy hands.</p>
<p>9 Be not very angry, O Lord, and remember no longer our iniquity: behold, see we are all thy people.</p>
<p>10 The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is made a desert, Jerusalem is desolate.</p>
<p>11 The house of our holiness, and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt with fire, and all our lovely things are turned into ruins.</p>
<p>12 Wilt thou refrain thyself, O Lord, upon these things, wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us vehemently?</p>
