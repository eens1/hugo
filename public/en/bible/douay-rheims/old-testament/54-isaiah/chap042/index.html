<h1>Chapter 42</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Behold my servant, I will uphold him: my elect, my soul delighteth in him: I have given my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2 He shall not cry, nor have respect to person, neither shall his voice be heard abroad.</p>
<p>3 The bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he shall not quench, he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</p>
<p>4 He shall not be sad, nor troublesome, till he set judgment in the earth, and the islands shall wait for his law.</p>
<p>5 Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens, and stretched them out: that established the earth, and the things that spring out of it: that giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread thereon.</p>
<p>6 I the Lord have called thee in justice, and taken thee by the hand, and preserved thee. And I have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles:</p>
<p>7 That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring forth the prisoner out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>
<p>8 I the Lord, this is my name: I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven things.</p>
<p>9 The things that were first, behold they are come: and new things do I declare: before they spring forth, I will make you hear them.</p>
<p>10 Sing ye to the Lord a new song, his praise is from the ends of the earth: you that go down to the sea, and all that are therein: ye islands, and ye inhabitants of them.</p>
<p>11 Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted: Cedar shall dwell in houses: ye inhabitants of Petra, give praise, they shall cry from the top of the mountains.</p>
<p>12 They shall give glory to the Lord, and shall declare his praise in the islands.</p>
<p>13 The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, as a man of war shall he stir up zeal: he shall shout and cry: he shall prevail against his enemies.</p>
<p>14 I have always held my peace, I have kept silence, I have been patient, I will speak now as a woman in labour: I will destroy, and swallow up at once.</p>
<p>15 I will lay waste the mountains and hills, and will make all their grass to wither: and I will turn rivers into islands, and will dry up the standing pools.</p>
<p>16 And I will lead the blind into the way which they know not: and in the paths which they were ignorant of I will make them walk: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight: these things have I done to them, and have not forsaken them.</p>
<p>17 They are turned back: let them be greatly confounded, that trust in a graven thing, that say to a molten thing: You are our god.</p>
<p>18 Hear, ye deaf, and, ye blind, behold that you may see.</p>
<p>19 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he to whom I have sent my messengers? Who is blind, but he that is sold? or who is blind, but the servant of the Lord?</p>
<p>20 Thou that seest many things, wilt thou not observe them? thou that hast ears open, wilt thou not hear?</p>
<p>21 And the Lord was willing to sanctify him, and to magnify the law, and exalt it.</p>
<p>22 But this is a people that is robbed and wasted: they are all the snare of young men, and they are hid in the houses of prisons: they are made a prey, and there is none to deliver them: a spoil, and there is none that saith: Restore.</p>
<p>23 Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that will attend and hearken for times to come?</p>
<p>24 Who hath given Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers? hath not the Lord himself, against whom we have sinned? And they would not walk in his ways, and they have not hearkened to his law.</p>
<p>25 And he hath poured out upon him the indignation of his fury, and a strong battle, and hath burnt him round about, and he knew not: and set him on fire, and he understood not.</p>
