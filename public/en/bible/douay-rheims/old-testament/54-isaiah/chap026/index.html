<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 In that day shall this canticle be sung in the land of Juda. Sion the city of our strength a saviour, a wall and a bulwark shall be set therein.</p>
<p>2 Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in.</p>
<p>3 The old error is passed away: thou wilt keep peace: peace, because we have hoped in thee.</p>
<p>4 You have hoped in the Lord for evermore, in the Lord God mighty for ever.</p>
<p>5 For he shall bring down them that dwell on high, the high city he shall lay low. He shall bring it down even to the ground, he shall pull it down even to the dust.</p>
<p>6 The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.</p>
<p>7 The way of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in.</p>
<p>8 And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently waited for thee: thy name, and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul.</p>
<p>9 My soul hath desired thee in the night: yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee. When thou shalt do thy judgments on the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn justice.</p>
<p>10 Let us have pity on the wicked, but he will not learn justice: in the land of the saints he hath done wicked things, and he shall not see the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Lord, let thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: let the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thy enemies.</p>
<p>12 Lord, thou wilt give us peace: for thou hast wrought all our works for us.</p>
<p>13 O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us, only in thee let us remember thy name.</p>
<p>14 Let not the dead live, let not the giants rise again: therefore hast visited and destroyed them, and hast destroyed all their memory.</p>
<p>15 Thou hast been favourable to the nation, O Lord, thou hast been favourable to the nation: art thou glorified? thou hast removed all the ends of the earth far off.</p>
<p>16 Lord, they have sought after thee in distress, in the tribulation of murmuring thy instruction was with them.</p>
<p>17 As a woman with child, when she draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs: so are we become in thy presence, O Lord.</p>
<p>18 We have conceived, and been as it were in labour, and have brought forth wind: we have not wrought salvation on the earth, therefore the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen.</p>
<p>19 Thy dead men shall live, my slain shall rise again: awake, and give praise, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is the dew of the light: and the land of the giants thou shalt pull down into ruin.</p>
<p>20 Go, my people, enter into thy chambers, shut thy doors upon thee, hide thyself a little for a moment, until the indignation pass away.</p>
<p>21 For behold the Lord will come out of his place, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall cover her slain no more.</p>
