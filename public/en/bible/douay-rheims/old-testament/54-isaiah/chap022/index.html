<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee also, that thou too art wholly gone up to the housetops?</p>
<p>2 Full of clamour, a populous city, a joyous city: thy slain are not slain by the sword, nor dead in battle.</p>
<p>3 All the princes are fled together, and are bound hard: all that were found, are bound together, they are fled far off.</p>
<p>4 Therefore have I said: Depart from me, I will weep bitterly: labour not to comfort me, for the devastation of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p>5 For it is a day of slaughter and of treading down, and of weeping to the Lord the God of hosts in the valley of vision, searching the wall, and magnificent upon the mountain.</p>
<p>6 And Elam took the quiver, the chariot of the horseman, and the shield was taken down from the wall.</p>
<p>7 And thy choice valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall place themselves in the gate.</p>
<p>8 And the covering of Juda shall be discovered, and thou shalt see in that day the armoury of the house of the forest.</p>
<p>9 And you shall see the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and you have gathered together the waters of the lower pool,</p>
<p>10 And have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and broken down houses to fortify the wall.</p>
<p>11 And you made a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: and you have not looked up to the maker thereof, nor regarded him even at a distance, that wrought it long ago.</p>
<p>12 And the Lord, the God of hosts, in that day shall call to weeping, and to mourning, to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:</p>
<p>13 And behold joy and gladness, killing calves, and slaying rams, eating flesh, and drinking wine: Let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.</p>
<p>14 And the voice of the Lord of hosts was revealed in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till you die, saith the Lord God of hosts.</p>
<p>15 Thus saith the Lord God of hosts: Go, get thee in to him that dwelleth in the tabernacle, to Sobna who is over the temple: and thou shalt say to him:</p>
<p>16 What dost thou here, or as if thou wert somebody here? for thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, thou hast hewed out a monument carefully in a high place, a dwelling for thyself in a rock.</p>
<p>17 Behold the Lord will cause thee to be carried away, as a cock is carried away, and he will lift thee up as a garment.</p>
<p>18 He will crown thee with a crown of tribulation, he will toss thee like a ball into a large and spacious country: there shalt thou die, and there shall the chariot of thy glory be, the shame of the house of thy Lord.</p>
<p>19 And I will drive thee out from thy station, and depose thee from thy ministry.</p>
<p>20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliacim the son of Helcias,</p>
<p>21 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and will strengthen him with thy girdle, and will give thy power into his hand: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Juda.</p>
<p>22 And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and none shall shut: and he shall shut, and none shall open.</p>
<p>23 And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place, and he shall be for a throne of glory to the house of his father.</p>
<p>24 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father&rsquo;s house, divers kinds of vessels, every little vessel, from the vessels of cups even to every instrument of music.</p>
<p>25 In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall the peg be removed, that was fastened in the sure place: and it shall be broken and shall fall: and that which hung thereon, shall perish, because the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
