<h1>Chapter 57</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The just perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and men of mercy are taken away, because there is none that understandeth; for the just man is taken away from before the face of evil.</p>
<p>2 Let peace come, let him rest in his bed that hath walked in his uprightness.</p>
<p>3 But draw near hither, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer, and of the harlot.</p>
<p>4 Upon whom have you jested? upon whom have you opened your mouth wide, and put out your tongue? are not you wicked children, a false seed,</p>
<p>5 Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree, sacrificing children in the torrents, under the high rocks?</p>
<p>6 In the parts of the torrent is thy portion, this is thy lot: and thou hast poured out libations to them, thou hast offered sacrifice. Shall I not be angry at these things?</p>
<p>7 Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed, and hast gone up thither to offer victims.</p>
<p>8 And behind the door, and behind the post thou hast set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open hand.</p>
<p>9 And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment, and hast multiplied thy perfumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far off, and wast debased even to hell.</p>
<p>10 Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet thou saidst not: I will rest: thou has found life of thy hand, therefore thou hast not asked.</p>
<p>11 For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou hast forgotten me.</p>
<p>12 I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not profit thee.</p>
<p>13 When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away, but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and shall possess my holy mount.</p>
<p>14 And I will say: Make a way: give free passage, turn out of the path, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people.</p>
<p>15 For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</p>
<p>16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, and breathings I will make.</p>
<p>17 For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went away wandering in his own heart.</p>
<p>18 I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back, and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for him.</p>
<p>19 I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed him.</p>
<p>20 But the wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest, and the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire.</p>
<p>21 There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord God.</p>
