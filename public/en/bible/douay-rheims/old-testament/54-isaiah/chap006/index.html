<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple.</p>
<p>2 Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they flew.</p>
<p>3 And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory,</p>
<p>4 And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p>5 And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>6 And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar.</p>
<p>7 And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed.</p>
<p>8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me.</p>
<p>9 And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not.</p>
<p>10 Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them.</p>
<p>11 And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate.</p>
<p>12 And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p>13 And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed.</p>
