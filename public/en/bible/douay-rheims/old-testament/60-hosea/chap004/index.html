<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p>2 Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery, have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.</p>
<p>3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.</p>
<p>4 But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.</p>
<p>5 And thou shalt fall today, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.</p>
<p>6 My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</p>
<p>7 According to the multitude of them, so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</p>
<p>8 They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity.</p>
<p>9 And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.</p>
<p>10 And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing the law.</p>
<p>11 Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness, take away the understanding.</p>
<p>12 My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them, and they have committed fornication against their God.</p>
<p>13 They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt incense upon the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the turpentine tree, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters commit fornication, and your spouses shall be adulteresses.</p>
<p>14 I will not visit upon your daughters, when they shall commit fornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: because themselves conversed with harlots, and offered sacrifice with the effeminate, and the people that doth not understand shall be beaten.</p>
<p>15 If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend: and go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not swear: The Lord liveth.</p>
<p>16 For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place.</p>
<p>17 Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone.</p>
<p>18 Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication: they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon them.</p>
<p>19 The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be confounded because of their sacrifices.</p>
