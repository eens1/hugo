<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</p>
<p>2 Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</p>
<p>3 Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</p>
<p>4 Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</p>
<p>5 Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall, and labour.</p>
<p>6 Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</p>
<p>7 Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</p>
<p>8 Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</p>
<p>9 Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</p>
<p>10 Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</p>
<p>11 Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</p>
<p>12 Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</p>
<p>13 He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</p>
<p>14 He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</p>
<p>15 He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</p>
<p>16 Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</p>
<p>17 Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</p>
<p>18 Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</p>
<p>19 Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p>20 Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</p>
<p>21 Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</p>
<p>22 Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</p>
<p>23 Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p>24 Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</p>
<p>25 Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</p>
<p>26 Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</p>
<p>27 Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</p>
<p>28 Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</p>
<p>29 Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</p>
<p>30 Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</p>
<p>31 Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</p>
<p>32 Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>33 Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</p>
<p>34 Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</p>
<p>35 Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
<p>36 Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</p>
<p>37 Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</p>
<p>38 Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</p>
<p>39 Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</p>
<p>40 Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</p>
<p>41 Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.</p>
<p>42 Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</p>
<p>43 Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</p>
<p>44 Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</p>
<p>45 Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</p>
<p>46 Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
<p>47 Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.</p>
<p>48 Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p>49 Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</p>
<p>50 Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</p>
<p>51 Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p>52 Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</p>
<p>53 Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</p>
<p>54 Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</p>
<p>55 Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</p>
<p>56 Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</p>
<p>57 Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</p>
<p>58 Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.</p>
<p>59 Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.</p>
<p>60 Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.</p>
<p>61 Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.</p>
<p>62 Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.</p>
<p>63 Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</p>
<p>64 Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</p>
<p>65 Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</p>
<p>66 Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</p>
