<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p>1 Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider and behold our reproach.</p>
<p>2 Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers.</p>
<p>3 We are become orphans without a father: our mothers are as widows.</p>
<p>4 We have drunk our water for money: we have bought our wood.</p>
<p>6 We were dragged by the necks, we were weary and no rest was given us.</p>
<p>6 We have given our hand to Egypt, and to the Assyrians, that we might be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p>7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not: and we have borne their iniquities.</p>
<p>8 Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of their hand.</p>
<p>9 We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the desert.</p>
<p>10 Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the violence of the famine.</p>
<p>11 They oppressed the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of Juda.</p>
<p>12 The princes were hanged up by their hand: they did not respect the persons of the ancients.</p>
<p>13 They abused the young men indecently: and the children fell under the wood.</p>
<p>14 The ancients have ceased from the gates: the young men from the choir of the singers.</p>
<p>15 The joy of our heart is ceased, our dancing is turned into mourning.</p>
<p>16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe to us, because we have sinned.</p>
<p>17 Therefore is our heart sorrowful, therefore are our eyes become dim.</p>
<p>18 For mount Sion, because it is destroyed, foxes have walked upon it.</p>
<p>19 But thou, O Lord, shalt remain for ever, thy throne from generation to generation.</p>
<p>20 Why wilt thou forget us for ever? why wilt thou forsake us for a long time?</p>
<p>21 Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted: renew our days, as from the beginning.</p>
<p>22 But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art exceedingly angry with us.</p>
