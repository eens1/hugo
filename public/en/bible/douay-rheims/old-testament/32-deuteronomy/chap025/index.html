<h1>Chapter 25</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 If there be a controversy between men, and they call upon the judges: they shall give the prize of justice to him whom they perceive to be just: and him whom they find to be wicked, they shall condemn of wickedness.</p>
<p>2 And if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes: they shall lay him down, and shall cause him to be beaten before them. According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be:</p>
<p>3 Yet so, that they exceed not the number of forty: lest thy brother depart shamefully torn before thy eyes.</p>
<p>4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out thy corn on the floor.</p>
<p>5 When brethren dwell together, and one of them dieth without children, the wife of the deceased shall not marry to another: but his brother shall take her, and raise up seed for his brother:</p>
<p>6 And the first son he shall have of her he shall call by his name, that his name be not abolished out of Israel.</p>
<p>7 But if he will not take his brother&rsquo;s wife, who by law belongeth to him, the woman shall go to the gate of the city, and call upon the ancients, and say: My husband&rsquo;s brother refuseth to raise up his brother&rsquo;s name in Israel: and will not take me to wife.</p>
<p>8 And they shall cause him to be sent for forthwith, and shall ask him. If he answer: I will not take her to wife:</p>
<p>9 The woman shall come to him before the ancients, and shall take off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and say: So shall it be done to the man that will not build up his brother&rsquo;s house:</p>
<p>10 And his name shall be called in Israel, the house of the unshod.</p>
<p>11 If two men have words together, and one begin to fight against the other, and the other&rsquo;s wife willing to deliver her husband out of the hand of the stronger, shall put forth her hand, and take him by the secrets,</p>
<p>12 Thou shalt cut off her hand, neither shalt thou be moved with any pity in her regard.</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a less:</p>
<p>14 Neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and a less.</p>
<p>15 Thou shalt have a just and a true weight, and thy bushel shall be equal and true: that thou mayest live a long time upon the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.</p>
<p>16 For the Lord thy God abhorreth him that doth these things, and he hateth all injustice.</p>
<p>17 Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out of Egypt:</p>
<p>18 How he met thee: and slew the hindmost of the army, who sat down, being weary, when thou wast spent with hunger and labour, and he feared not God.</p>
<p>19 Therefore when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest, and shall have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he hath promised thee: thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven. See thou forget it not.</p>
