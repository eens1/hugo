      <description>1 The words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.&#xA;2 Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes: vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.&#xA;3 What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun?&#xA;4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever.&#xA;5 The sun riseth, and goeth down, and returneth to his place: and there rising again,</description>

      <description>1 Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.&#xA;2 The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.&#xA;3 Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.&#xA;4 If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.</description>

      <description>1 Cast thy bread upon the running waters: for after a long time thou shalt find it again.&#xA;2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.&#xA;3 If the clouds be full, they will pour out rain upon the earth. If the tree fall to the south, or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be.</description>

      <description>1 Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the time of affliction come, and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say: They please me not:&#xA;2 Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars be darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:&#xA;3 When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall stagger, and the grinders shall be idle in a small number, and they that look through the holes shall be darkened:</description>

      <description>1 I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity.&#xA;2 Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?&#xA;3 I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.</description>

      <description>1 All things have their season, and in their times all things pass under heaven.&#xA;2 A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.&#xA;3 A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build.&#xA;4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance.</description>

      <description>1 I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.&#xA;2 And I praised the dead rather than the living:&#xA;3 And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.</description>

      <description>1 Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.&#xA;2 Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.&#xA;3 If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.</description>

      <description>1 There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men:&#xA;2 A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.&#xA;3 If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he.</description>

      <description>1 What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him under the sun?&#xA;2 A good name is better than precious ointments: and the day of death than the day of one&amp;rsquo;s birth.</description>

      <description>1 The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.&#xA;2 I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath of God.&#xA;3 Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him:&#xA;4 And his word is full of power: neither can any man say to him: Why dost thou so?</description>

      <description>1 All these things have I considered in my heart, that I might carefully understand them: there are just men and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God: and yet man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or hatred:&#xA;2 But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come, because all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil, to the clean and to the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him that despiseth sacrifices.</description>
