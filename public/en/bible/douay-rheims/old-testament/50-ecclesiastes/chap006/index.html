<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men:</p>
<p>2 A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.</p>
<p>3 If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he.</p>
<p>4 For he came in vain, and goeth to darkness, and his name shall be wholly forgotten.</p>
<p>5 He hath not seen the sun, nor known the distance of good and evil:</p>
<p>6 Although he lived two thousand years, and hath not enjoyed good things: do not all make haste to one place?</p>
<p>7 All the labour of man is for his mouth, but his soul shall not be filled.</p>
<p>8 What hath the wise man more than the fool? and what the poor man, but to go thither, where there is life?</p>
<p>9 Better it is to see what thou mayst desire, than to desire that which thou canst not know. But this also is vanity, and presumption of spirit.</p>
<p>10 He that shall be, his name is already called: and it is known, that he is a man, and cannot contend in judgment with him that is stronger than himself.</p>
<p>11 There are many words that have much vanity in disputing.</p>
