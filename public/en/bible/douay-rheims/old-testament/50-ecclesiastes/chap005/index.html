<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</p>
<p>2 Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.</p>
<p>3 If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.</p>
<p>4 And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised.</p>
<p>5 Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands.</p>
<p>6 Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God.</p>
<p>7 If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these:</p>
<p>8 Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him.</p>
<p>9 A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity.</p>
<p>10 Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes?</p>
<p>11 Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>
<p>12 There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner.</p>
<p>13 For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want.</p>
<p>14 As he came forth naked from his mother&rsquo;s womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.</p>
<p>15 A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?</p>
<p>16 All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow.</p>
<p>17 This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion.</p>
<p>18 And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God.</p>
<p>19 For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight.</p>
