<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I, Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,</p>
<p>2 Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.</p>
<p>3 And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward</p>
<p>4 I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.</p>
<p>5 And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p>6 And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.</p>
<p>7 And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
<p>8 And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p>9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength.</p>
<p>10 And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them.</p>
<p>11 And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.</p>
<p>12 And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.</p>
<p>13 And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another I know not to whom, that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?</p>
<p>14 And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</p>
<p>15 And it came to pass when I, Daniel, saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.</p>
<p>16 And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p>17 And he came, and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face, trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>18 And when he spoke to me, I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p>19 And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.</p>
<p>20 The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.</p>
<p>21 And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.</p>
<p>22 But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it, four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.</p>
<p>23 And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.</p>
<p>24 And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,</p>
<p>25 According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.</p>
<p>26 And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou, therefore, seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.</p>
<p>27 And I, Daniel, languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king&rsquo;s business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it.</p>
