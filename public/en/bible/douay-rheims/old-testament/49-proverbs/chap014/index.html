<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish will pull down with her hands that also which is built.</p>
<p>2 He that walketh in the right way, and feareth God, is despised by him that goeth by an infamous way.</p>
<p>3 In the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wise preserve them.</p>
<p>4 Where there are no oxen, the crib is empty: but where there is much corn, there the strength of the ox is manifest.</p>
<p>5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a deceitful witness uttereth a lie.</p>
<p>6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: the learning of the wise is easy.</p>
<p>7 Go against a foolish man, and he knoweth not the lips of prudence.</p>
<p>8 The wisdom of a discreet man is to understand his way: and the imprudence of fools erreth.</p>
<p>9 A fool will laugh at sin, but among the just grace shall abide.</p>
<p>10 The heart that knoweth the bitterness of his own soul, in his joy the stranger shall not intermeddle.</p>
<p>11 The house of the wicked shall be destroyed: but the tabernacles of the just shall flourish.</p>
<p>12 There is a way which seemeth just to a man: but the ends thereof lead to death.</p>
<p>13 Laughter shall be mingled with sorrow, and mourning taketh hold of the ends of joy.</p>
<p>14 A fool shall be filled with his own ways, and the good man shall be above him.</p>
<p>15 The innocent believeth every word: the discreet man considereth his steps. No good shall come to the deceitful son: but the wise servant shall prosper in his dealings, and his way shall be made straight.</p>
<p>16 A wise man feareth, and declineth from evil: the fool leapeth over, and is confident.</p>
<p>17 The impatient man shall work folly: and the crafty man is hateful.</p>
<p>18 The childish shall possess folly, and the prudent shall look for knowledge.</p>
<p>19 The evil shall fall down before the good: and the wicked before the gates of the just.</p>
<p>20 The poor man shall be hateful even to his own neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.</p>
<p>21 He that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth: but he that sheweth mercy to the poor, shall be blessed. He that believeth in the Lord, loveth mercy.</p>
<p>22 They err that work evil: but mercy and truth prepare good things.</p>
<p>23 In much work there shall be abundance: but where there are many words, there is oftentimes want.</p>
<p>24 The crown of the wise, is their riches: the folly of fools, imprudence.</p>
<p>25 A faithful witness delivereth souls: and the double dealer uttereth lies.</p>
<p>26 In the fear of the Lord is confidence of strength, and there shall be hope for his children.</p>
<p>27 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to decline from the ruin of death.</p>
<p>28 In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king: and in the small number of the people the dishonour of the prince.</p>
<p>29 He that is patient, is governed with much wisdom: but he that is impatient, exalteth his folly.</p>
<p>30 Soundness of heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones.</p>
<p>31 He that oppresseth the poor, upbraideth his maker: but he that hath pity on the poor, honoureth him.</p>
<p>32 The wicked man shall be driven out in his wickedness: but the just hath hope in his death.</p>
<p>33 In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom, and it shall instruct all the ignorant.</p>
<p>34 Justice exalteth a nation: but sin maketh nations miserable.</p>
<p>35 A wise servant is acceptable to the king: he that is good for nothing shall feel his anger.</p>
