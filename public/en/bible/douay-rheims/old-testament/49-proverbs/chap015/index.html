<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A mild answer breaketh wrath: but a harsh word stirreth up fury.</p>
<p>2 The tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge: but the mouth of fools bubbleth out folly.</p>
<p>3 The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the good and the evil.</p>
<p>4 A peaceable tongue is a tree of life: but that which is immoderate, shall crush the spirit.</p>
<p>5 A fool laugheth at the instruction of his father: but he that regardeth reproofs shall become prudent. In abundant justice there is the greatest strength: but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted out.</p>
<p>6 The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p>7 The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike.</p>
<p>8 The victims of the wicked are abominable to the Lord: the vows of the just are acceptable.</p>
<p>9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: he that followeth justice is beloved by him.</p>
<p>10 Instruction is grievous to him that forsaketh the way of life: he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>
<p>11 Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?</p>
<p>12 A corrupt man loveth not one that reproveth him: nor will he go to the wise.</p>
<p>13 A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by grief of mind the spirit is cast down.</p>
<p>14 The heart of the wise seeketh instruction: and the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</p>
<p>15 All the days of the poor are evil: a secure mind is like a continual feast.</p>
<p>16 Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasures without content.</p>
<p>17 It is better to be invited to herbs with love, than to a fatted calf with hatred.</p>
<p>18 A passionate man stirreth up strifes: he that is patient appeaseth those that are stirred up.</p>
<p>19 The way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns: the way of the just is without offence.</p>
<p>20 A wise son maketh a father joyful: but the foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p>21 Folly is joy to the fool: and the wise man maketh straight his steps.</p>
<p>22 Designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel: but where there are many counsellors, they are established.</p>
<p>23 A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth: and a word in due time is best.</p>
<p>24 The path of life is above for the wise, that he may decline from the lowest hell.</p>
<p>25 The Lord will destroy the house of the proud: and will strengthen the borders of the widow.</p>
<p>26 Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord: and pure words most beautiful shall be confirmed by him.</p>
<p>27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house: but he that hateth bribes shall live. By mercy and faith sins are purged away: and by the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil.</p>
<p>28 The mind of the just studieth obedience: the mouth of the wicked overfloweth with evils.</p>
<p>29 The Lord is far from the wicked: and he will hear the prayers of the just.</p>
<p>30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name maketh the bones fat.</p>
<p>31 The ear that heareth the reproofs of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise.</p>
<p>32 He that rejecteth instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof, possesseth understanding.</p>
<p>33 The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wisdom: and humility goeth before glory.</p>
