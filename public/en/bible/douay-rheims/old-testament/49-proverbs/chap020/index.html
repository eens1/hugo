<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Wine is a luxurious thing, and drunkenness riotous: whosoever is delighted therewith, shall not be wise.</p>
<p>2 As the roaring of a lion, so also is the dread of a king: he that provoketh him, sinneth against his own soul.</p>
<p>3 It is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels: but all fools are meddling with reproaches.</p>
<p>4 Because of the cold the sluggard would not plough: he shall beg therefore in the summer, and it shall not be given him.</p>
<p>5 Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water: but a wise man will draw it out.</p>
<p>6 Many men are called merciful: but who shall find a faithful man?</p>
<p>7 The just that walketh in his simplicity, shall leave behind him blessed children.</p>
<p>8 The king, that sitteth on the throne of judgment, scattereth away all evil with his look.</p>
<p>9 Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin?</p>
<p>10 Diverse weights and diverse measures, both are abominable before God.</p>
<p>11 By his inclinations a child is known, if his works be clean and right.</p>
<p>12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made them both.</p>
<p>13 Love not sleep, lest poverty oppress thee: open thy eyes, and be filled with bread.</p>
<p>14 It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer: and when he is gone away, then he will boast.</p>
<p>15 There is gold and a multitude of jewels: but the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.</p>
<p>16 Take away the garment of him that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge from him for strangers.</p>
<p>17 The bread of lying is sweet to a man: but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>
<p>18 Designs are strengthened by counsels: and wars are to be managed by governments.</p>
<p>19 Meddle not with him that revealeth secrets, and walketh deceitfully, and openeth wide his lips.</p>
<p>20 He that curseth his father, and mother, his lamp shall be put out in the midst of darkness.</p>
<p>21 The inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning, in the end shall be without a blessing.</p>
<p>22 Say not: I will return evil: wait for the Lord, and he will deliver thee.</p>
<p>23 Diverse weights are an abomination before the Lord: a deceitful balance is not good.</p>
<p>24 The steps of men are guided by the Lord: but who is the man that can understand his own way?</p>
<p>25 It is ruin to a man to devour holy ones, and after vows to retract.</p>
<p>26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth over them the wheel.</p>
<p>27 The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, which searcheth all the hidden things of the bowels.</p>
<p>28 Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency.</p>
<p>29 The joy of young men is their strength: and the dignity of old men, their grey hairs.</p>
<p>30 The blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils: and stripes in the more inward parts of the belly.</p>
