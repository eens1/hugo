<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 It is the part of man to prepare the soul: and of the Lord to govern the tongue.</p>
<p>2 All the ways of a man are open to his eyes: the Lord is the weigher of spirits.</p>
<p>3 Lay open thy works to the Lord: and thy thoughts shall be directed.</p>
<p>4 The Lord hath made all things for himself: the wicked also for the evil day.</p>
<p>5 Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice: and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.</p>
<p>6 By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed; and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</p>
<p>7 When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.</p>
<p>8 Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity.</p>
<p>9 The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.</p>
<p>10 Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.</p>
<p>11 Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.</p>
<p>12 They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice.</p>
<p>13 Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.</p>
<p>14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: and the wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p>15 In the cheerfulness of the king&rsquo;s countenance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.</p>
<p>16 Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</p>
<p>17 The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.</p>
<p>18 Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.</p>
<p>19 It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.</p>
<p>20 The learned in word shall find good things: and he that trusteth in the Lord is blessed.</p>
<p>21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and he that is sweet in words, shall attain to greater things.</p>
<p>22 Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it: the instruction of fools is foolishness.</p>
<p>23 The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth: and shall add grace to his lips.</p>
<p>24 Well ordered words are as a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p>25 There is a way that seemeth to a man right: and the ends thereof lead to death.</p>
<p>26 The soul of him that laboureth, laboureth for himself, because his mouth hath obliged him to it.</p>
<p>27 The wicked man diggeth evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.</p>
<p>28 A perverse man stirreth up quarrels: and one full of words separateth princes.</p>
<p>29 An unjust man allureth his friend: and leadeth him into a way that is not good.</p>
<p>30 He that with fixed eyes deviseth wicked things, biting his lips, bringeth evil to pass.</p>
<p>31 Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.</p>
<p>32 The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh cities.</p>
<p>33 Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord.</p>
