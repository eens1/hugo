<h1>Chapter 27</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Boast not for to morrow, for thou knowest not what the day to come may bring forth.</p>
<p>2 Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips.</p>
<p>3 A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.</p>
<p>4 Anger hath no mercy: nor fury, when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?</p>
<p>5 Open rebuke is better than hidden love.</p>
<p>6 Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.</p>
<p>7 A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb: and a soul that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.</p>
<p>8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth his place.</p>
<p>9 Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.</p>
<p>10 Thy own friend, and thy father&rsquo;s friend, forsake not: and go not into thy brother&rsquo;s house in the day of thy affliction. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother afar off.</p>
<p>11 Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.</p>
<p>12 The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself: little ones passing on have suffered losses.</p>
<p>13 Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and take from him a pledge for strangers.</p>
<p>14 He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising in the night, shall be like to him that curseth.</p>
<p>15 Roofs dropping through in a cold day, and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
<p>16 He that retaineth her, is as he that would hold the wind, and shall call the oil of his right hand.</p>
<p>17 Iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p>18 He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: and he that is the keeper of his master, shall be glorified.</p>
<p>19 As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.</p>
<p>20 Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.</p>
<p>21 As silver is tried in the fining-pot, and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.</p>
<p>22 Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.</p>
<p>23 Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider thy own flocks:</p>
<p>24 For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given to generation and generation.</p>
<p>25 The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered out of the mountains.</p>
<p>26 Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.</p>
<p>27 Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food, and for the necessities of thy house, and for maintenance for thy handmaids.</p>
