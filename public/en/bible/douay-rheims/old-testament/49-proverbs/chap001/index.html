<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,</p>
<p>2 To know wisdom, and instruction:</p>
<p>3 To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:</p>
<p>4 To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>5 A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth shall possess governments.</p>
<p>6 He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.</p>
<p>7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p>8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p>9 That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.</p>
<p>10 My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.</p>
<p>11 If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p>12 Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.</p>
<p>13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.</p>
<p>14 Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.</p>
<p>15 My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.</p>
<p>16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p>17 But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.</p>
<p>18 And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls.</p>
<p>19 So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.</p>
<p>20 Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p>21 At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:</p>
<p>22 O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?</p>
<p>23 Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.</p>
<p>24 Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.</p>
<p>25 You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.</p>
<p>26 I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.</p>
<p>27 When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:</p>
<p>28 Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning, and shall not find me:</p>
<p>29 Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the Lord,</p>
<p>30 Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.</p>
<p>31 Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p>32 The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p>33 But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.</p>
