<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee,</p>
<p>2 That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: incline thy heart to know prudence.</p>
<p>3 For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence:</p>
<p>4 If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure:</p>
<p>5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God:</p>
<p>6 Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge.</p>
<p>7 He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity,</p>
<p>8 Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.</p>
<p>9 Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path.</p>
<p>10 If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul:</p>
<p>11 Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,</p>
<p>12 That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things:</p>
<p>13 Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:</p>
<p>14 Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most wicked things:</p>
<p>15 Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.</p>
<p>16 That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the stranger, who softeneth her words;</p>
<p>17 And forsaketh the guide of her youth,</p>
<p>18 And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.</p>
<p>19 None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p>20 That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just.</p>
<p>21 For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the simple shall continue in it.</p>
<p>22 But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do unjustly, shall be taken away from it.</p>
