<h1>Chapter 10</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A wise son maketh the father glad: but a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother.</p>
<p>2 Treasures of wickedness shall profit nothing: but justice shall deliver from death.</p>
<p>3 The Lord will not afflict the soul of the just with famine, and he will disappoint the deceitful practices of the wicked.</p>
<p>4 The slothful hand hath wrought poverty: but the hand of the industrious getteth riches. He that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds: and the same runneth after birds, that fly away.</p>
<p>5 He that gathereth in the harvest, is a wise son: but he that snorteth in the summer, is the son of confusion.</p>
<p>6 The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but iniquity covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p>7 The memory of the just is with praises: and the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>
<p>8 The wise of heart receiveth precepts: a fool is beaten with lips.</p>
<p>9 He that walketh sincerely, walketh confidently: but he that perverteth his ways, shall be manifest.</p>
<p>10 He that winketh with the eye, shall cause sorrow: and the foolish in lips shall be beaten.</p>
<p>11 The mouth of the just is a vein of life: and the mouth of the wicked covereth iniquity.</p>
<p>12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: and charity covereth all sins.</p>
<p>13 In the lips of the wise is wisdom found: and a rod on the back of him that wanteth sense.</p>
<p>14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the fool is next to confusion.</p>
<p>15 The substance of a rich man is the city of his strength: the fear of the poor is their poverty.</p>
<p>16 The work of the just is unto life: but the fruit of the wicked unto sin.</p>
<p>17 The way of life, to him that observeth correction: but he that forsaketh reproofs, goeth astray.</p>
<p>18 Lying lips hide hatred: he that uttereth reproach, is foolish.</p>
<p>19 In the multitude of words there shall not want sin: but he that refraineth his lips, is most wise.</p>
<p>20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: but the heart of the wicked is nothing worth.</p>
<p>21 The lips of the just teach many: but they that are ignorant, shall die in the want of understanding.</p>
<p>22 The blessing of the Lord maketh men rich: neither shall affliction be joined to them.</p>
<p>23 A fool worketh mischief as it were for sport: but wisdom is prudence to a man.</p>
<p>24 That which the wicked feareth, shall come upon him: to the just their desire shall be given.</p>
<p>25 As a tempest that passeth, so the wicked shall be no more: but the just is as an everlasting foundation.</p>
<p>26 As vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that sent him.</p>
<p>27 The fear of the Lord shall prolong days: and the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p>28 The expectation of the just is joy: but the hope of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>29 The strength of the upright is the way of the Lord: and fear to them that work evil.</p>
<p>30 The just shall never be moved: but the wicked shall not dwell on the earth.</p>
<p>31 The mouth of the just shall bring forth wisdom: the tongue of the perverse shall perish.</p>
<p>32 The lips of the just consider what is acceptable: and the mouth of the wicked uttereth perverse things.</p>
