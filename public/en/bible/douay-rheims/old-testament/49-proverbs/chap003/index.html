<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.</p>
<p>2 For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life, and peace.</p>
<p>3 Let not mercy aud truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart.</p>
<p>4 And thou shalt find grace, and good understanding before God and men.</p>
<p>5 Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence.</p>
<p>6 In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.</p>
<p>7 Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil:</p>
<p>8 For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones.</p>
<p>9 Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits;</p>
<p>10 And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine.</p>
<p>11 My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised by him:</p>
<p>12 For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.</p>
<p>13 Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence:</p>
<p>14 The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chief and purest gold:</p>
<p>15 She is more precious than all riches: and all the things that are desired, are not to be compared to her.</p>
<p>16 Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory.</p>
<p>17 Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable.</p>
<p>18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and he that shall retain her is blessed.</p>
<p>19 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the heavens by prudence.</p>
<p>20 By his wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew.</p>
<p>21 My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes: keep the law and counsel:</p>
<p>22 And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth.</p>
<p>23 Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble:</p>
<p>24 If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p>25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked falling upon thee.</p>
<p>26 For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken.</p>
<p>27 Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able: if thou art able, do good thyself also.</p>
<p>28 Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again: and to morrow I will give to thee: when thou canst give at present.</p>
<p>29 Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in thee.</p>
<p>30 Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no evil.</p>
<p>31 Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways.</p>
<p>32 For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is with the simple.</p>
<p>33 Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked: but the habitations of the just shall be blessed.</p>
<p>34 He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace.</p>
<p>35 The wise shall possess glory: the promotion of fools is disgrace.</p>
