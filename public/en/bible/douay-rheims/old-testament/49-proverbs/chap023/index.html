<h1>Chapter 23</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince, consider diligently what is set before thy face:</p>
<p>2 And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul in thy own power.</p>
<p>3 Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.</p>
<p>4 Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.</p>
<p>5 Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly towards heaven.</p>
<p>6 Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats:</p>
<p>7 Because, like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.</p>
<p>8 The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt loose thy beautiful words.</p>
<p>9 Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.</p>
<p>10 Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field of the fatherless:</p>
<p>11 For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.</p>
<p>12 Let thy heart apply itself to instruction and thy ears to words of knowledge.</p>
<p>13 Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p>14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p>15 My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:</p>
<p>16 And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is right.</p>
<p>17 Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:</p>
<p>18 Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end, and thy expectation shall not be taken away.</p>
<p>19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.</p>
<p>20 Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings, who contribute flesh to eat:</p>
<p>21 Because they that give themselves to drinking, and that club together, shall be consumed: and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.</p>
<p>22 Hearken to thy father, that begot thee: and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p>23 Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p>24 The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a wise son, shall have joy in him.</p>
<p>25 Let thy father and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that bore thee.</p>
<p>26 My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.</p>
<p>27 For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p>28 She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall see unwary, she will kill.</p>
<p>29 Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who falls into pits? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p>30 Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink off their cups.</p>
<p>31 Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,</p>
<p>32 But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.</p>
<p>33 Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p>34 And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost.</p>
<p>35 And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake and find wine again?</p>
