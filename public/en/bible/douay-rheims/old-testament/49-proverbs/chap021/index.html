<h1>Chapter 21</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 As the divisions of waters, so the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord: whithersoever he will, he shall turn it.</p>
<p>2 Every way of a man seemeth right to himself: but the Lord weigheth the hearts.</p>
<p>3 To do mercy and judgment, pleaseth the Lord more than victims.</p>
<p>4 Haughtiness of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart: the lamp of the wicked is sin.</p>
<p>5 The thoughts of the industrious always bring forth abundance: but every sluggard is always in want.</p>
<p>6 He that gathereth treasures by a lying tongue, is vain and foolish, and shall stumble upon the snares of death.</p>
<p>7 The robberies of the wicked shall be their downfall, because they would not do judgment.</p>
<p>8 The perverse way of a man is strange: but as for him that is pure, his work is right.</p>
<p>9 It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.</p>
<p>10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil, he will not have pity on his neighbour.</p>
<p>11 When a pestilent man is punished, the little one will be wiser: and if he follow the wise, he will receive knowledge.</p>
<p>12 The just considereth seriously the house of the wicked, that he may withdraw the wicked from evil.</p>
<p>13 He that stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor, shall also cry himself, and shall not be heard.</p>
<p>14 A secret present quencheth anger: and a gift in the bosom, the greatest wrath.</p>
<p>15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: and dread to them that work iniquity.</p>
<p>16 A man that shall wander out of the way of doctrine, shall abide in the company of the giants.</p>
<p>17 He that loveth good cheer, shall be in want: he that loveth wine, and fat things, shall not be rich.</p>
<p>18 The wicked is delivered up for the just: and the unjust for the righteous.</p>
<p>19 It is better to dwell in a wilderness, than with a quarrelsome and passionate woman.</p>
<p>20 There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the just: and the foolish man shall spend it.</p>
<p>21 He that followeth justice and mercy, shall find life, justice, and glory.</p>
<p>22 The wise man hath scaled the city of the strong, and hath cast down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p>23 He that keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from distress.</p>
<p>24 The proud and the arrogant is called ignorant, who in anger worketh pride.</p>
<p>25 Desires kill the slothful: for his hands have refused to work at all.</p>
<p>26 He longeth and desireth all the day: but he that is just, will give, and will not cease.</p>
<p>27 The sacrifices of the wicked are abominable, because they are offered of wickedness.</p>
<p>28 A lying witness shall perish: an obedient man shall speak of victory.</p>
<p>29 The wicked man impudently hardeneth his face: but he that is righteous, correcteth his way.</p>
<p>30 There is no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel against the Lord.</p>
<p>31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but the Lord giveth safety.</p>
