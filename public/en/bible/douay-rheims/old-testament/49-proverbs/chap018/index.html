<h1>Chapter 18</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 He that hath a mind to depart from a friend, seeketh occasions: he shall ever be subject to reproach.</p>
<p>2 A fool receiveth not the words of prudence: unless thou say those things which are in his heart.</p>
<p>3 The wicked man, when he is come into the depths of sins, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him.</p>
<p>4 Words from the mouth of a man are as deep water: and the fountain of wisdom is an overflowing stream.</p>
<p>5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to decline from the truth of judgment.</p>
<p>6 The lips of a fool intermeddle with strife: and his mouth provoketh quarrels.</p>
<p>7 The mouth of a fool is his destruction: and his lips are the ruin of his soul.</p>
<p>8 The words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless: and they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels. Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry.</p>
<p>9 He that is loose and slack in his work, is the brother of him that wasteth his own works.</p>
<p>10 The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the just runneth to it, and shall be exalted.</p>
<p>11 The substance of the rich man is the city of his strength, and as a strong wall compassing him about.</p>
<p>12 Before destruction, the heart of a man is exalted: and before he be glorified, it is humbled.</p>
<p>13 He that answereth before he heareth, sheweth himself to be a fool, and worthy of confusion.</p>
<p>14 The spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity: but a spirit that is easily angered, who can bear?</p>
<p>15 A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction.</p>
<p>16 A man&rsquo;s gift enlargeth his way, and maketh him room before princes.</p>
<p>17 The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him.</p>
<p>18 The lot suppresseth contentions, and determineth even between the mighty.</p>
<p>19 A brother that is helped by his brother, is like a strong city: and judgments are like the bars of cities.</p>
<p>20 Of the fruit of a man&rsquo;s mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and the offspring of his lips shall fill him.</p>
<p>21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: they that love it, shall eat the fruits thereof.</p>
<p>22 He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and shall receive a pleasure from the Lord. He that driveth away a good wife, driveth away a good thing: but he that keepeth an adulteress, is foolish and wicked.</p>
<p>23 The poor will speak with supplications, and the rich will speak roughly.</p>
<p>24 A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother.</p>
