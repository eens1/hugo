<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A good name is better than great riches: and good favour is above silver and gold.</p>
<p>2 The rich and poor have met one another: the Lord is the maker of them both.</p>
<p>3 The prudent man saw the evil, and hid himself: the simple passed on, and suffered loss.</p>
<p>4 The fruit of humility is the fear of the Lord, riches and glory and life.</p>
<p>5 Arms and swords are in the way of the perverse: but he that keepeth his own soul, departeth far from them.</p>
<p>6 It is a proverb: A young man according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
<p>7 The rich ruleth over the poor: and the borrower is servant to him that lendeth.</p>
<p>8 He that soweth iniquity, shall reap evils, and with the rod of his anger he shall be consumed.</p>
<p>9 He that is inclined to mercy, shall be blessed: for of his bread he hath given to the poor. He that maketh presents, shall purchase victory and honour: but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers.</p>
<p>10 Cast out the scoffer, and contention shall go out with him, and quarrels and reproaches shall cease.</p>
<p>11 He that loveth cleanness of heart, for the grace of his lips shall have the king for his friend.</p>
<p>12 The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge: and the words of the unjust are overthrown.</p>
<p>13 The slothful man saith: There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the midst of the streets.</p>
<p>14 The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit: he whom the Lord is angry with, shall fall into it.</p>
<p>15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and the rod of correction shall drive it away.</p>
<p>16 He that oppresseth the poor, to increase his own riches, shall himself give to one that is richer, and shall be in need.</p>
<p>17 Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy heart to my doctrine:</p>
<p>18 Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels, and it shall flow in thy lips:</p>
<p>19 That thy trust may be in the Lord, wherefore I have also shewn it to thee this day.</p>
<p>20 Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways, in thoughts and knowledge:</p>
<p>21 That I might shew thee the certainty, and the words of truth, to answer out of these to them that sent thee.</p>
<p>22 Do no violence to the poor, because he is poor: and do not oppress the needy in the gate:</p>
<p>23 Because the Lord will judge his cause: and will afflict them that have afflicted his soul.</p>
<p>24 Be not a friend to an angry man, and do not walk with a furious man:</p>
<p>25 Lest perhaps thou learn his ways, and take scandal to thy soul.</p>
<p>26 Be not with them that fasten down their hands, and that offer themselves sureties for debts:</p>
<p>27 For if thou have not wherewith to restore, what cause is there that he should take the covering from thy bed?</p>
<p>28 Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p>29 Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure.</p>
