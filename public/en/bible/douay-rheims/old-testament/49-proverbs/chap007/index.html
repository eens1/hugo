<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my precepts with thee. Son,</p>
<p>2 Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thy eye:</p>
<p>3 Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.</p>
<p>4 Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,</p>
<p>5 That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from the stranger who sweeteneth her words.</p>
<p>6 For I looked out of the window of my house through the lattice,</p>
<p>7 And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,</p>
<p>8 Who passeth through the street by the corner, and goeth nigh the way of her house,</p>
<p>9 In the dark when it grows late, in the darkness and obscurity of the night.</p>
<p>10 And behold a woman meeteth him in harlot&rsquo;s attire, prepared to deceive souls: talkative and wandering,</p>
<p>11 Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,</p>
<p>12 Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners.</p>
<p>13 And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent face, flattereth, saying:</p>
<p>14 I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.</p>
<p>15 Therefore I am come out to meet thee, desirous to see thee, and I have found thee.</p>
<p>16 I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.</p>
<p>17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p>18 Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the desired embraces, till the day appear.</p>
<p>19 For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.</p>
<p>20 He took with him a bag of money: he will return home the day of the full moon.</p>
<p>21 She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the flattery of her lips.</p>
<p>22 Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to bonds,</p>
<p>23 Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.</p>
<p>24 Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>25 Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths.</p>
<p>26 For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been slain by her.</p>
<p>27 Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers of death.</p>
