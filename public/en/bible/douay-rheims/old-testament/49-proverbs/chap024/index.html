<h1>Chapter 24</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them:</p>
<p>2 Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak deceits.</p>
<p>3 By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be strengthened.</p>
<p>4 By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious and most beautiful wealth.</p>
<p>5 A wise man is strong: and a knowing man, stout and valiant.</p>
<p>6 Because war is managed by due ordering: and there shall be safety where there are many counsels.</p>
<p>7 Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he shall not open his mouth.</p>
<p>8 He that deviseth to do evils, shall be called a fool.</p>
<p>9 The thought of a fool is sin: and the detractor is the abomination of men.</p>
<p>10 If thou lose hope, being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.</p>
<p>11 Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death, forbear not to deliver.</p>
<p>12 If thou say: I have not strength enough: he that seeth into the heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul, and he shall render to a man according to his works.</p>
<p>13 Eat honey, my son, because it is good, and the honeycomb most sweet to thy throat.</p>
<p>14 So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou hast found, thou shalt have hope in the end, and thy hope shall not perish.</p>
<p>15 Lie not in wait, nor seek after wickedness in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.</p>
<p>16 For a just man shall fall seven times, and shall rise again: but the wicked shall fall down into evil.</p>
<p>17 When thy enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not thy heart rejoice:</p>
<p>18 Lest the Lord see, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
<p>19 Contend not with the wicked, nor seek to be like the ungodly.</p>
<p>20 For evil men have no hope of things to come, and the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p>21 My son, fear the Lord, and the king: and have nothing to do with detractors.</p>
<p>22 For their destruction shall rise suddenly: and who knoweth the ruin of both?</p>
<p>23 These things also to the wise: It is not good to have respect to persons in judgment.</p>
<p>24 They that say to the wicked man: Thou art just: shall be cursed by the people, and the tribes shall abhor them.</p>
<p>25 They that rebuke him shall be praised: and a blessing shall come upon them.</p>
<p>26 He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words.</p>
<p>27 Prepare thy work without, and diligently till thy ground: that afterward thou mayst build thy house.</p>
<p>28 Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: and deceive not any man with thy lips.</p>
<p>29 Say not: I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to every one according to his work.</p>
<p>30 I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of the foolish man:</p>
<p>31 And behold it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down.</p>
<p>32 Which when I had seen, I laid it up in my heart, and by the example I received instruction.</p>
<p>33 Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest.</p>
<p>34 And poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an armed man.</p>
