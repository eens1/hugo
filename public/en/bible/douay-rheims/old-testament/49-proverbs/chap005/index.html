<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence,</p>
<p>2 That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.</p>
<p>3 For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.</p>
<p>4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p>5 Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.</p>
<p>6 They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable.</p>
<p>7 Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.</p>
<p>9 Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.</p>
<p>10 Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>11 And thou mourn at the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say;</p>
<p>12 Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,</p>
<p>13 And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not inclined my ear to masters?</p>
<p>14 I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.</p>
<p>15 Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:</p>
<p>16 Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters.</p>
<p>17 Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee.</p>
<p>18 Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:</p>
<p>19 Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times: be thou delighted continually with her love.</p>
<p>20 Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another?</p>
<p>21 The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.</p>
<p>22 His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.</p>
<p>23 He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.</p>
