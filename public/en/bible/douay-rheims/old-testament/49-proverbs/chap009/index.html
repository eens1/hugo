<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars.</p>
<p>2 She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table.</p>
<p>3 She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:</p>
<p>4 Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:</p>
<p>5 Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.</p>
<p>6 Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.</p>
<p>7 He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself; and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p>8 Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p>9 Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.</p>
<p>10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is prudence.</p>
<p>11 For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.</p>
<p>12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil.</p>
<p>13 A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all,</p>
<p>14 Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the city,</p>
<p>15 To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:</p>
<p>16 He that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she said:</p>
<p>17 Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant.</p>
<p>18 And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</p>
