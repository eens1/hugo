<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger,</p>
<p>2 Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.</p>
<p>3 Do, therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:</p>
<p>4 Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.</p>
<p>5 Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p>6 Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:</p>
<p>7 Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,</p>
<p>8 Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p>9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p>10 Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:</p>
<p>11 And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.</p>
<p>12 A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,</p>
<p>13 He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.</p>
<p>14 With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.</p>
<p>15 To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.</p>
<p>16 Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:</p>
<p>17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p>18 A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,</p>
<p>19 A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p>20 My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</p>
<p>21 Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.</p>
<p>22 When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.</p>
<p>23 Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p>24 That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.</p>
<p>25 Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:</p>
<p>26 For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.</p>
<p>27 Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?</p>
<p>28 Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?</p>
<p>29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.</p>
<p>30 The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:</p>
<p>31 And if he be taken, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.</p>
<p>32 But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:</p>
<p>33 He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:</p>
<p>34 Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,</p>
<p>35 Nor will he yield to any man&rsquo;s prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.</p>
