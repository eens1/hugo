<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother instructed him.</p>
<p>2 What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows?</p>
<p>3 Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.</p>
<p>4 Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth:</p>
<p>5 And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor.</p>
<p>6 Give strong drink to them that are sad; and wine to them that are grieved in mind:</p>
<p>7 Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more.</p>
<p>8 Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass.</p>
<p>9 Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor.</p>
<p>10 Who shall find a valiant woman? far, and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.</p>
<p>11 The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils.</p>
<p>12 She will render him good, and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p>13 She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands.</p>
<p>14 She is like the merchant&rsquo;s ship, she bringeth her bread from afar.</p>
<p>15 And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maidens.</p>
<p>16 She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p>
<p>17 She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.</p>
<p>18 She hath tasted, and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night.</p>
<p>19 She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle.</p>
<p>20 She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor.</p>
<p>21 She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for all her domestics are clothed with double garments.</p>
<p>22 She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple, is her covering.</p>
<p>23 Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land.</p>
<p>24 She made fine linen, and sold it, and delivered a girdle to the Chanaanite.</p>
<p>25 Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day.</p>
<p>26 She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue.</p>
<p>27 She hath looked well on the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle.</p>
<p>28 Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her.</p>
<p>29 Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all.</p>
<p>30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</p>
<p>31 Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
