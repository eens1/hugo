<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.</p>
<p>2 This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.</p>
<p>3 Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>
<p>4 And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.</p>
<p>5 She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.</p>
<p>6 And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.</p>
<p>7 And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.</p>
<p>8 And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,</p>
<p>9 And he said to her: Who art thou ? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.</p>
<p>10 And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich.</p>
<p>11 Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>
<p>12 Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.</p>
<p>13 Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, so the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.</p>
<p>14 So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.</p>
<p>15 And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,</p>
<p>16 And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
<p>17 And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.</p>
<p>18 And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said.</p>
