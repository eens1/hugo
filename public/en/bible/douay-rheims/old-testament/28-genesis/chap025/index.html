<h1>Chapter 25</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Abraham married another wife named Cetura:</p>
<p>2 Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.</p>
<p>3 Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomim.</p>
<p>4 But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.</p>
<p>5 And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac:</p>
<p>6 And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.</p>
<p>7 And the days of Abraham&rsquo;s life were a hundred and seventy-five years.</p>
<p>8 And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p>9 And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre,</p>
<p>10 Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.</p>
<p>11 And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.</p>
<p>12 These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara&rsquo;s servant, bore unto him:</p>
<p>13 And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam,</p>
<p>14 And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,</p>
<p>15 Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.</p>
<p>16 These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.</p>
<p>17 And the years of Ismael&rsquo;s life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
<p>18 And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
<p>19 These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:</p>
<p>20 Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.</p>
<p>21 And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.</p>
<p>22 But the children struggled in her womb, and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.</p>
<p>23 And he answering, said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p>24 And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.</p>
<p>25 He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother&rsquo;s foot in his hand: and therefore he was called Jacob.</p>
<p>26 Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.</p>
<p>27 And when they were grown up, Esau became a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but Jacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.</p>
<p>28 Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.</p>
<p>29 And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,</p>
<p>30 Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.</p>
<p>31 And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.</p>
<p>32 He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?</p>
<p>33 Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.</p>
<p>34 And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.</p>
