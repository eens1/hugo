<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.</p>
<p>2 And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.</p>
<p>3 And each one said to his neighbour: Come let us make brick, and bake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stones, and slime instead of mortar:</p>
<p>4 And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.</p>
<p>5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam were building.</p>
<p>6 And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their designs, till they accomplish them in deed.</p>
<p>7 Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there confound their tongue, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>8 And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city.</p>
<p>9 And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.</p>
<p>10 These are the generations of Sem: Sem was a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad, two years after the flood.</p>
<p>11 And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad, five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>12 And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Sale.</p>
<p>13 And Arphaxad lived after he begot Sale, three hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>14 Sale also lived thirty years, and begot Heber.</p>
<p>15 And Sale lived after he begot Heber, four hundred and three years: and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>16 And Heber lived thirty-four years, and begot Phaleg.</p>
<p>17 And Heber lived after he begot Phaleg, four hundred and thirty years: and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>18 Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begot Reu.</p>
<p>19 And Phaleg lived after he begot Reu, two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>20 And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Sarug.</p>
<p>21 And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>22 And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot Nachor.</p>
<p>23 And Sarug lived after he begot Nachor, two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>24 And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Thare.</p>
<p>25 And Nachor lived after he begot Thare, a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>26 And Thare lived seventy years, and begot Abram, and Nachor, and Aran.</p>
<p>27 And these are the generations of Thare: Thare begot Abram, Nachor, and Aran. And Aran begot Lot.</p>
<p>28 And Aran died before Thare his father, in the land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p>29 And Abram and Nachor married wives: the name of Abram&rsquo;s wife was Sarai: and the name of Nachor&rsquo;s wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran, father of Melcha and father of Jescha.</p>
<p>30 And Sarai was barren, and had no children.</p>
<p>31 And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Aran, his son&rsquo;s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and brought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Chanaan: and they came as far as Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
<p>32 And the days of Thare were two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.</p>
