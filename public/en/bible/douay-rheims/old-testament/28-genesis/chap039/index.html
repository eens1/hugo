<h1>Chapter 39</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.</p>
<p>2 And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master&rsquo;s house:</p>
<p>3 Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
<p>4 And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:</p>
<p>5 And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph&rsquo;s sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home and in the fields.</p>
<p>6 Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.</p>
<p>7 And after many days, his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.</p>
<p>8 But he in no wise consenting to that wicked act said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:</p>
<p>9 Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do this wicked thing, and sin against my God?</p>
<p>10 With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.</p>
<p>11 Now it happened on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business, without any man with him:</p>
<p>12 And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.</p>
<p>13 And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,</p>
<p>14 She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and when I cried out,</p>
<p>15 And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.</p>
<p>16 For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:</p>
<p>17 And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me.</p>
<p>18 And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.</p>
<p>19 His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife&rsquo;s words, was very angry,</p>
<p>20 And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.</p>
<p>21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:</p>
<p>22 Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done, was under him.</p>
<p>23 Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper.</p>
