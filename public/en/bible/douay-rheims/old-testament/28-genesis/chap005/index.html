<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p>1 This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.</p>
<p>2 He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</p>
<p>3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.</p>
<p>4 And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>5 And all the time that Adam lived, came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.</p>
<p>6 Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.</p>
<p>7 And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.</p>
<p>9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.</p>
<p>10 After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.</p>
<p>12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.</p>
<p>13 And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.</p>
<p>15 And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and begot Jared.</p>
<p>16 And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>17 And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.</p>
<p>18 And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.</p>
<p>19 And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.</p>
<p>21 And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.</p>
<p>22 And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>23 And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.</p>
<p>24 And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.</p>
<p>25 And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.</p>
<p>26 And Mathlusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>27 And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.</p>
<p>28 And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.</p>
<p>29 And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth, which the Lord hath cursed.</p>
<p>30 And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p>31 And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.</p>
