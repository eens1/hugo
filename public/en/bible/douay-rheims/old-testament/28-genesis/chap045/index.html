<h1>Chapter 45</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.</p>
<p>2 And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao heard.</p>
<p>3 And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: Is my father yet living? His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.</p>
<p>4 And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</p>
<p>5 Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.</p>
<p>6 For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.</p>
<p>7 And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.</p>
<p>8 Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>9 Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come down to me, linger not.</p>
<p>10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons&rsquo; sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and all things that thou hast.</p>
<p>11 And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.</p>
<p>12 Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.</p>
<p>13 You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to me.</p>
<p>14 And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck.</p>
<p>15 And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to speak to him.</p>
<p>16 And it was heard, and the fame was spread abroad in the king&rsquo;s court: The brethren of Joseph are come; and Pharao with all his family was glad.</p>
<p>17 And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts, and go into the land of Chanaan,</p>
<p>18 And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.</p>
<p>19 Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:</p>
<p>20 And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.</p>
<p>21 And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao&rsquo;s commandment: and provisions for the way.</p>
<p>22 He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best:</p>
<p>23 Sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides, ten he-asses, to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she-asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.</p>
<p>24 So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not angry in the way.</p>
<p>25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob.</p>
<p>26 And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy son, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe them.</p>
<p>27 They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons, and all that he had sent, his spirit revived,</p>
<p>28 And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph, my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before I die.</p>
