<h1>Chapter 50</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father&rsquo;s face, weeping and kissing him.</p>
<p>2 And he commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father.</p>
<p>3 And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.</p>
<p>4 And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharao:</p>
<p>5 For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my father, and return.</p>
<p>6 And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.</p>
<p>7 So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao&rsquo;s house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>8 And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.</p>
<p>9 He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.</p>
<p>10 And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.</p>
<p>11 And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And therefore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.</p>
<p>12 So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them.</p>
<p>13 And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave, which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place, of Ephron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.</p>
<p>14 And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.</p>
<p>15 Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another: Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.</p>
<p>16 And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,</p>
<p>17 That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.</p>
<p>18 And his brethren came to him; and worshipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We are thy servants.</p>
<p>19 And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?</p>
<p>20 You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.</p>
<p>21 Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.</p>
<p>22 And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father&rsquo;s house; and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the sons of Manasses, were born on Joseph&rsquo;s knees.</p>
<p>23 After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>24 And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, carry my bones with you out of this place:</p>
<p>25 And he died, being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed, he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
