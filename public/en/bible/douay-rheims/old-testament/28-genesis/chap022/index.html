<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</p>
<p>2 He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee.</p>
<p>3 So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass, and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.</p>
<p>4 And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.</p>
<p>5 And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.</p>
<p>6 And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,</p>
<p>7 Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?</p>
<p>8 And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.</p>
<p>9 And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.</p>
<p>10 And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.</p>
<p>11 And behold, an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</p>
<p>12 And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.</p>
<p>13 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.</p>
<p>14 And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.</p>
<p>15 And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:</p>
<p>16 By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:</p>
<p>17 I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.</p>
<p>18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
<p>19 Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.</p>
<p>20 After these things, it was told Abraham, that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.</p>
<p>21 Hus, the firstborn, and Buz, his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians,</p>
<p>22 And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,</p>
<p>23 And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: these eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, Abraham&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>24 And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.</p>
