<h1>Chapter 32</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.</p>
<p>2 And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.</p>
<p>3 And he sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom:</p>
<p>4 And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day:</p>
<p>5 I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.</p>
<p>6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.</p>
<p>7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,</p>
<p>8 Saying: If Esau come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left, shall escape.</p>
<p>9 And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.</p>
<p>10 I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.</p>
<p>11 Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.</p>
<p>12 Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>13 And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau,</p>
<p>14 Two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
<p>15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten of their foals.</p>
<p>16 And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.</p>
<p>17 And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</p>
<p>18 Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob&rsquo;s: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.</p>
<p>19 In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.</p>
<p>20 And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us; for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.</p>
<p>21 So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.</p>
<p>22 And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.</p>
<p>23 And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,</p>
<p>24 He remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.</p>
<p>25 And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.</p>
<p>26 And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
<p>27 And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.</p>
<p>28 But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?</p>
<p>29 Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.</p>
<p>30 And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.</p>
<p>31 And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.</p>
<p>32 Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob&rsquo;s thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</p>
