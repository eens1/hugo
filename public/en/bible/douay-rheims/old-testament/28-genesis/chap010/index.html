<h1>Chapter 10</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.</p>
<p>2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.</p>
<p>3 And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.</p>
<p>4 And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim and Dodanim.</p>
<p>5 By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands, every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.</p>
<p>6 And the Sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.</p>
<p>7 And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.</p>
<p>8 Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.</p>
<p>9 And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.</p>
<p>10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.</p>
<p>11 Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.</p>
<p>12 Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.</p>
<p>13 And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim and Laabim, Nephthuim.</p>
<p>14 And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.</p>
<p>15 And Chanaan begot Sidon his firstborn, the Hethite,</p>
<p>16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite.</p>
<p>17 The Hevite and Aracite: the Sinite,</p>
<p>18 And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.</p>
<p>19 And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.</p>
<p>20 These are the children of Cham in their kindreds and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.</p>
<p>21 Of Sem also the father of all the children of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.</p>
<p>22 The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</p>
<p>23 The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and Gether; and Mes.</p>
<p>24 But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.</p>
<p>25 And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days was the earth divided: and his brother&rsquo;s name Jectan.</p>
<p>26 Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,</p>
<p>27 And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,</p>
<p>28 And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,</p>
<p>29 And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Jectan.</p>
<p>30 And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.</p>
<p>31 These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and tongues, and countries in their nations.</p>
<p>32 These are the families of Noe, according to their people and nations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.</p>
