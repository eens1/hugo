<h1>Chapter 40</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.</p>
<p>2 And Pharao being angry with them, (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)</p>
<p>3 He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.</p>
<p>4 But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.</p>
<p>5 And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:</p>
<p>6 And when Joseph was come into them in the morning, and saw them sad,</p>
<p>7 He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?</p>
<p>8 They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:</p>
<p>9 The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</p>
<p>10 On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:</p>
<p>11 And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.</p>
<p>12 Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches, are yet three days:</p>
<p>13 After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.</p>
<p>14 Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:</p>
<p>15 For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.</p>
<p>16 The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:</p>
<p>17 And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</p>
<p>18 Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets, are yet three days:</p>
<p>19 After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.</p>
<p>20 The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.</p>
<p>21 And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:</p>
<p>22 The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.</p>
<p>23 But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.</p>
