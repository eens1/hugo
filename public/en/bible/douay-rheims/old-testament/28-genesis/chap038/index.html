<h1>Chapter 38</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.</p>
<p>2 And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto her.</p>
<p>3 And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Her.</p>
<p>4 And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him Onan.</p>
<p>5 She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.</p>
<p>6 And Juda took a wife for Her, his first born, whose name was Thamar.</p>
<p>7 And Her, the first born of Juda, was wicked in the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.</p>
<p>8 Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in to thy brother&rsquo;s wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.</p>
<p>9 He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother&rsquo;s wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>10 And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did a detestable thing:</p>
<p>11 Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father&rsquo;s house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She went her way, and dwelt in her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>12 And after many days were past: the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his flock.</p>
<p>13 And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.</p>
<p>14 And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.</p>
<p>15 When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.</p>
<p>16 And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?</p>
<p>17 He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.</p>
<p>18 Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.</p>
<p>19 And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
<p>20 And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,</p>
<p>21 Asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,</p>
<p>22 He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover, the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.</p>
<p>23 Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.</p>
<p>24 And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.</p>
<p>25 But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.</p>
<p>26 But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.</p>
<p>27 And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:</p>
<p>28 This shall come forth the first.</p>
<p>29 But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.</p>
<p>30 Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his name Zara.</p>
