<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of thy father&rsquo;s house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
<p>2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed.</p>
<p>3 I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p>4 So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran.</p>
<p>5 And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&rsquo;s son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it,</p>
<p>6 Abram passed through the country unto the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.</p>
<p>7 And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.</p>
<p>8 And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.</p>
<p>9 And Abram went forward, going and proceeding on to the south.</p>
<p>10 And there came a famine in the country: and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.</p>
<p>11 And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:</p>
<p>12 And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.</p>
<p>13 Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.</p>
<p>14 And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.</p>
<p>15 And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao.</p>
<p>16 And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and men servants, and maid servants, and she asses, and camels.</p>
<p>17 But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>18 And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</p>
<p>19 For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
<p>20 And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
