<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be perfect.</p>
<p>2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.</p>
<p>3 Abram fell flat on his face.</p>
<p>4 And God said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</p>
<p>5 Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: because I have made thee a father of many nations.</p>
<p>6 And I will make thee increase exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</p>
<p>7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</p>
<p>8 And I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of thy sojournment, all the land of Chanaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will be their God.</p>
<p>9 Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</p>
<p>10 This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male-kind of you shall be circumcised.</p>
<p>11 And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you.</p>
<p>12 An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every manchild in your generations: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant, shall be circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock:</p>
<p>13 And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.</p>
<p>14 The male whose flesh of his foreskin shall not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant.</p>
<p>15 God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.</p>
<p>16 And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall become nations, and kings of people shall spring from him.</p>
<p>17 Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?</p>
<p>18 And he said to God: O that Ismael may live before thee.</p>
<p>19 And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, and with his seed after him.</p>
<p>20 And as for Ismael I have also heard thee. Behold, I will bless him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.</p>
<p>21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.</p>
<p>22 And when he had left off speaking with him, God went up from Abraham.</p>
<p>23 And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all that were born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him.</p>
<p>24 Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.</p>
<p>25 And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision.</p>
<p>26 The self-same day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son.</p>
<p>27 And all the men of his house, as well they that were born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers, were circumcised with him.</p>
