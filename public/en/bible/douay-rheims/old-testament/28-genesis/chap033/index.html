<h1>Chapter 33</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids.</p>
<p>2 And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.</p>
<p>3 And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.</p>
<p>4 Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept.</p>
<p>5 And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me, thy servant.</p>
<p>6 Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves.</p>
<p>7 Lia also, with her children, came near and bowed down in like manner; and last of all, Joseph and Rachel bowed down.</p>
<p>8 And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.</p>
<p>9 But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.</p>
<p>10 And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me,</p>
<p>11 And take the blessing which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother&rsquo;s earnest pressing him,</p>
<p>12 And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.</p>
<p>13 And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.</p>
<p>14 May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.</p>
<p>15 Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.</p>
<p>16 So Esau returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.</p>
<p>17 And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.</p>
<p>18 And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town.</p>
<p>19 And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred lambs.</p>
<p>20 And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.</p>
