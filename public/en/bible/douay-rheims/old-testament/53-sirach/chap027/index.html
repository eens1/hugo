<h1>Chapter 27</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Through poverty many have sinned: and he that seeketh to be enriched, turneth away his eye.</p>
<p>2 As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick fast.</p>
<p>3 Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.</p>
<p>4 Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.</p>
<p>5 As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain: so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.</p>
<p>6 The furnace trieth the potter&rsquo;s vessels, and the trial of affliction just men.</p>
<p>7 As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man.</p>
<p>8 Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the trial of men.</p>
<p>9 If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her: and shalt put her on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell with her: and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowledgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.</p>
<p>10 Birds resort unto their like: so truth will return to them that practise her.</p>
<p>11 The lion always lieth in wait for prey: so do sins for them that work iniquities.</p>
<p>12 A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: but a fool is changed as the moon.</p>
<p>13 In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time: but be continually among men that think.</p>
<p>14 The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin.</p>
<p>15 The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head stand upright: and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears.</p>
<p>16 In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood: and their cursing is a grievous hearing.</p>
<p>17 He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.</p>
<p>18 Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with fidelity.</p>
<p>19 But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after him.</p>
<p>20 For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so is he that destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour.</p>
<p>21 And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him again.</p>
<p>22 Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded.</p>
<p>23 Thou canst no more bind him up. And of a curse there is reconciliation:</p>
<p>24 But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.</p>
<p>25 He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:</p>
<p>26 In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.</p>
<p>27 I have hated many things but not like him, and the Lord will hate him.</p>
<p>28 If one cast a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head: and the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful.</p>
<p>29 He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.</p>
<p>30 A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him.</p>
<p>31 Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him.</p>
<p>32 They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of the just: and sorrow shall consume them before they die.</p>
<p>33 Anger and fury are both of them abominable, and the sinful man shall be subject to them.</p>
