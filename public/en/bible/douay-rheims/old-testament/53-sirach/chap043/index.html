<h1>Chapter 43</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The firmament on high is his beauty, the beauty of heaven with its glorious shew.</p>
<p>2 The sun when he appeareth shewing forth at his rising, an admirable instrument, the work of the most High.</p>
<p>3 At noon he burneth the earth, and who can abide his burning heat? As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:</p>
<p>4 The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.</p>
<p>5 Great is the Lord that made him, and at his words he hath hastened his course.</p>
<p>6 And the moon in all in her season, is for a declaration of times and a sign of the world.</p>
<p>7 From the moon is the sign of the festival day, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.</p>
<p>8 The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her perfection.</p>
<p>9 Being an instrument of the armies on high, shining gloriously in the firmament of heaven.</p>
<p>10 The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven; the Lord enlighteneth the world on high.</p>
<p>11 By the words of the holy one they stand in judgment, and shall never fall in their watches.</p>
<p>12 Look upon the rainbow, and bless him that made it: it is very beautiful in its brightness.</p>
<p>13 It encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory, the hands of the most High have displayed it.</p>
<p>14 By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, and sendeth forth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.</p>
<p>15 Through this are the treasures opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.</p>
<p>16 By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds, and the hailstones are broken.</p>
<p>17 At his sight shall the mountains be shaken, and at his will the south wind shall blow.</p>
<p>18 The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth, so doth the northern storm, and the whirlwind:</p>
<p>19 And as the birds lighting upon the earth, he scattereth snow, and the falling thereof, is as the coming down of locusts.</p>
<p>20 The eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the shower thereof.</p>
<p>21 He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth: and when it freezeth, it shall become like the tops of thistles.</p>
<p>22 The cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into crystal; upon every gathering together of waters it shall rest, and shall clothe the waters as a breastplate.</p>
<p>23 And it shall devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and consume all that is green as with fire.</p>
<p>24 A present remedy of all is the speedy coming of a cloud, and a dew that meeteth it, by the heat that cometh, shall overpower it.</p>
<p>25 At his word the wind is still, and with his thought he appeaseth the deep, and the Lord hath planted islands therein.</p>
<p>26 Let them that sail on the sea, tell the dangers thereof: and when we hear with our ears, we shall admire.</p>
<p>27 There are great and wonderful works: a variety of beasts, and of all living things, and the monstrous creatures of whales.</p>
<p>28 Through him is established the end of their journey, and by his word all things are regulated.</p>
<p>29 We shall say much, and yet shall want words: but the sum of our words is, He is all.</p>
<p>30 What shall we be able to do to glorify him? for the Almighty himself is above all his works.</p>
<p>31 The Lord is terrible, and exceeding great, and his power is admirable.</p>
<p>32 Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can, for he will yet far exceed, and his magnificence is wonderful.</p>
<p>33 Blessing the Lord, exalt him as much as you can; for he is above all praise.</p>
<p>34 When you exalt him put forth all your strength, and be not weary: for you can never go far enough.</p>
<p>35 Who shall see him, and declare him? and who shall magnify him as he is from the beginning?</p>
<p>36 There are many things hidden from us that are greater than these: for we have seen but a few of his works.</p>
<p>37 But the Lord hath made all things, and to the godly he hath given wisdom.</p>
