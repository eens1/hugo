<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.</p>
<p>2 Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.</p>
<p>3 Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?</p>
<p>4 He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.</p>
<p>5 He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.</p>
<p>6 There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness:</p>
<p>7 And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his wickedness.</p>
<p>8 The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.</p>
<p>9 The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.</p>
<p>10 An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.</p>
<p>11 My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.</p>
<p>12 Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.</p>
<p>13 Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.</p>
<p>14 Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift overpass thee.</p>
<p>15 Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?</p>
<p>16 Give and take, and justify thy soul.</p>
<p>17 Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.</p>
<p>18 All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that springeth out on a green tree.</p>
<p>19 Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.</p>
<p>20 Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and the worker thereof shall go with it.</p>
<p>21 And every excellent work shall be justified: and the worker thereof shall be honoured therein.</p>
<p>22 Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye of God.</p>
<p>23 He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that traceth, and stayeth in her ways.</p>
<p>24 He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her door.</p>
<p>25 He that lodgeth near her house, and fastening a pin in her walls shall set up his tent high unto her, where good things shall rest in his lodging for ever.</p>
<p>26 He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches:</p>
<p>27 He shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.</p>
