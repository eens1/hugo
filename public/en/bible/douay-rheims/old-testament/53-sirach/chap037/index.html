<h1>Chapter 37</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?</p>
<p>2 But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.</p>
<p>3 O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?</p>
<p>4 There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.</p>
<p>5 There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly&rsquo;s sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy.</p>
<p>6 Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.</p>
<p>7 Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.</p>
<p>8 Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.</p>
<p>9 Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:</p>
<p>10 Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:</p>
<p>11 Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.</p>
<p>12 Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,</p>
<p>13 Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the field laborer of every work,</p>
<p>14 Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.</p>
<p>15 But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,</p>
<p>16 Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.</p>
<p>17 And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.</p>
<p>18 The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch.</p>
<p>19 But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.</p>
<p>20 In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.</p>
<p>21 A wicked word shall change the heart: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.</p>
<p>22 A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.</p>
<p>23 He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.</p>
<p>24 Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.</p>
<p>25 There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.</p>
<p>26 A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.</p>
<p>27 A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.</p>
<p>28 The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.</p>
<p>29 A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.</p>
<p>30 My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:</p>
<p>31 For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.</p>
<p>32 Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:</p>
<p>33 For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.</p>
<p>34 By surfeiting many have perished, but he that is temperate, shall prolong life.</p>
