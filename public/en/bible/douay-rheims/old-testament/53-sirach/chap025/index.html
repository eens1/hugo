<h1>Chapter 25</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:</p>
<p>2 The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.</p>
<p>3 Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:</p>
<p>4 A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.</p>
<p>5 The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?</p>
<p>6 O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!</p>
<p>7 O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!</p>
<p>8 Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.</p>
<p>9 Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.</p>
<p>10 A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.</p>
<p>11 Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.</p>
<p>12 Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.</p>
<p>13 How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.</p>
<p>14 The fear of God hath set itself above all things:</p>
<p>15 Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?</p>
<p>16 The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.</p>
<p>17 The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.</p>
<p>18 And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:</p>
<p>19 And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:</p>
<p>20 And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:</p>
<p>21 And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</p>
<p>22 There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:</p>
<p>23 And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.</p>
<p>24 The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,</p>
<p>25 Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.</p>
<p>26 All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.</p>
<p>27 As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.</p>
<p>28 Look not upon a woman&rsquo;s beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.</p>
<p>29 A woman&rsquo;s anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.</p>
<p>30 A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.</p>
<p>31 A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.</p>
<p>32 Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.</p>
<p>33 From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.</p>
<p>34 Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.</p>
<p>35 If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.</p>
<p>36 Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.</p>
