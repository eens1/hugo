<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 God created man of the earth, and made him after his own image.</p>
<p>2 And he turned him into it again, and clothed him with strength according to himself.</p>
<p>3 He gave him the number of his days and time, and gave him power over all things that are upon the earth.</p>
<p>4 He put the fear of him upon all flesh, and he had dominion over beasts and fowls.</p>
<p>5 He created of him a helpmate like to himself, he gave them counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, and ears, and a heart to devise: and he filled them with the knowledge of understanding.</p>
<p>6 He created in them the science of the spirit, he fired their heart with wisdom, and shewed them both good and evil.</p>
<p>7 He set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the greatness of his works:</p>
<p>8 That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified: and glory in his wondrous act that they might declare the glorious things of his works.</p>
<p>9 Moreover he gave them instructions, and the law of life for an inheritance.</p>
<p>10 He made an everlasting covenant with them, and he shewed them his justice and judgments.</p>
<p>11 And their eye saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice, and he said to them: Beware of all iniquity.</p>
<p>12 And he gave to every one of them commandment concerning his neighbour.</p>
<p>13 Their ways are always before him, they are not hidden from his eyes.</p>
<p>14 Over every nation he set a ruler.</p>
<p>15 And Israel was made the manifest portion of God.</p>
<p>16 And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God: and his eyes are continually upon their ways.</p>
<p>17 Their covenants were not hid by their iniquity, and all their iniquities are in the sight of God.</p>
<p>18 The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and shall preserve the grace of a man as the apple of the eye:</p>
<p>19 And afterward he shall rise up, and shall render them their reward, to every one upon their own head, and shall turn them down into the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p>20 But to the penitent he hath given the way of justice, and he hath strengthened them that were fainting in patience, and hath appointed to them the lot of truth.</p>
<p>21 Turn to the Lord, and forsake thy sins:</p>
<p>22 Make thy prayer before the face of the Lord, and offend less.</p>
<p>23 Return to the Lord, and turn away from thy injustice, and greatly hate abomination.</p>
<p>24 And know the justices and judgments of God, and stand firm in the lot set before thee, and in prayer to the most high God.</p>
<p>25 Go to the side of the holy age, with them that live and give praise to God.</p>
<p>26 Tarry not in the error of the ungodly, give glory before death. Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing.</p>
<p>27 Give thanks whilst thou art living, whilst thou art alive and in health thou shalt give thanks, and shalt praise God, and shalt glory in his mercies.</p>
<p>28 How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness to them that turn to him !</p>
<p>29 For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal, and they are delighted with the vanity of evil.</p>
<p>30 What is brighter than the sun; yet it shall be eclipsed. Or what is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented? and this shall be reproved.</p>
<p>31 He beholdeth the power of the height of heaven: and all men are earth and ashes.</p>
