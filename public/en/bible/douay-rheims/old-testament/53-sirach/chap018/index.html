<h1>Chapter 18</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 He that liveth for ever created all things together. God only shall be justified, and he remaineth an invincible king for ever.</p>
<p>2 Who is able to declare his works?</p>
<p>3 For who shall search out his glorious acts?</p>
<p>4 And who shall show forth the power of his majesty? or who shall be able to declare his mercy?</p>
<p>5 Nothing may be taken away, nor added, neither is it possible to find out the glorious works of God.</p>
<p>6 When a man hath done, then shall he begin: and when he leaveth off, he shall be at a loss.</p>
<p>7 What is man, and what is his grace? and what is his good, or what is his evil?</p>
<p>8 The number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years, as a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed: and as a pebble of the sand, so are a few years compared to eternity.</p>
<p>9 Therefore God is patient in them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.</p>
<p>10 He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked, and hath known their end that it is evil.</p>
<p>11 Therefore hath he filled up his mercy in their favour, and hath shewn them the way of justice.</p>
<p>12 The compassion of man is toward his neighbour: but the mercy of God is upon all flesh.</p>
<p>13 He hath mercy, and teacheth, and correcteth, as a shepherd doth his flock.</p>
<p>14 He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy, and that maketh haste in his judgments.</p>
<p>15 My son, in thy good deeds, make no complaint, and when thou givest any thing, add not grief by an evil word.</p>
<p>16 Shall not the dew assuage the heat? so also the good word is better than the gift.</p>
<p>17 Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a justified man.</p>
<p>18 A fool will upbraid bitterly: and a gift of one ill taught consumeth the eyes.</p>
<p>19 Before judgment prepare thee justice, and learn before thou speak.</p>
<p>20 Before sickness take a medicine, and before judgment examine thyself, and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of God.</p>
<p>21 Humble thyself before thou art sick, and in the time of sickness shew thy conversation.</p>
<p>22 Let nothing hinder thee from praying always, and be not afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of God continueth for ever.</p>
<p>23 Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that tempteth God.</p>
<p>24 Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day, and the time of repaying when he shall turn away his face.</p>
<p>25 Remember poverty in the time of abundance, and the necessities of poverty in the day of riches.</p>
<p>26 From the morning until the evening the time shall be changed, and all these are swift in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>27 A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the days of sins will beware of sloth.</p>
<p>28 Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give praise to him that findeth her.</p>
<p>29 They that were of good understanding in words, have also done wisely themselves: and have understood truth and justice, and have poured forth proverbs and judgments.</p>
<p>30 Go not after thy lusts, but turn away from thy own will.</p>
<p>31 If thou give to thy soul her desires, she will make thee a joy to thy enemies.</p>
<p>32 Take no pleasure in riotous assemblies, be they ever so small: for their concertation is continual.</p>
<p>33 Make not thyself poor by borrowing to contribute to feasts when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own life.</p>
