<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the thought thereof driveth away sleep.</p>
<p>2 The thinking beforehand turneth away the understanding, and a grievous sickness maketh the soul sober.</p>
<p>3 The rich man hath laboured in gathering riches together, and when he resteth he shall be filled with his goods.</p>
<p>4 The poor man hath laboured in his low way of life, and in the end he is still poor.</p>
<p>5 He that loveth gold, shall not be justified: and he that followeth after corruption, shall be filled with it.</p>
<p>6 Many have been brought to fall for gold, and the beauty thereof hath been their ruin.</p>
<p>7 Gold is a stumblingblock to them that sacrifice to it: woe to them that eagerly follow after it, and every fool shall perish by it.</p>
<p>8 Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures.</p>
<p>9 Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.</p>
<p>10 Who hath been tried thereby, and made perfect, he shall have glory everlasting. He that could have transgressed, and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things, and hath not done them:</p>
<p>11 Therefore are his goods established in the Lord, and all the church of the saints shall declare his alms.</p>
<p>12 Art thou set at a great table? be not the first to open thy mouth upon it.</p>
<p>13 Say not: There are many things which are upon it.</p>
<p>14 Remember that a wicked eye is evil.</p>
<p>15 What is created more wicked than an eye? therefore shall it weep over all the face when it shall see.</p>
<p>16 Stretch not out thy hand first, lest being disgraced with envy thou be put to confusion.</p>
<p>17 Be not hasty in a feast.</p>
<p>18 Judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself.</p>
<p>19 Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee: lest if thou eatest much, thou be hated.</p>
<p>20 Leave off first, for manners&rsquo; sake: and exceed not, lest thou offend.</p>
<p>21 And if thou sittest among many, reach not thy hand out first of all, and be not the first to ask for drink.</p>
<p>22 How sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught, and in sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it, and thou shalt feel no pain.</p>
<p>23 Watching, and choler, and gripes, are with an intemperate man:</p>
<p>24 Sound and wholesome sleep with a moderate man: he shall sleep till morning, and his soul shall be delighted with him.</p>
<p>25 And if thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, go out, and vomit: and it shall refresh thee, and thou shalt not bring sickness upon thy body.</p>
<p>26 Hear me, my son, and despise me not: and in the end thou shalt find my words.</p>
<p>27 In all thy works be quick, and no infirmity shall come to thee.</p>
<p>28 The lips of many shall bless him that is liberal of his bread, and the testimony of his truth is faithful.</p>
<p>29 Against him that is niggardly of his bread, the city will murmur, and the testimony of his niggardliness is true.</p>
<p>30 Challenge not them that love wine: for wine hath destroyed very many.</p>
<p>31 Fire trieth hard iron: so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the hearts of the proud.</p>
<p>32 Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men: if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober.</p>
<p>33 What is his life, who is diminished with wine?</p>
<p>34 What taketh away life? death.</p>
<p>35 Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk.</p>
<p>36 Wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the heart.</p>
<p>37 Sober drinking is health to soul and body.</p>
<p>38 Wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath, and many ruins.</p>
<p>39 Wine drunken with excess is bitterness of the soul.</p>
<p>40 The heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool, lessening strength and causing wounds.</p>
<p>41 Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine: and despise him not in his mirth.</p>
<p>42 Speak not to him words of reproach: and press him not in demanding again.</p>
