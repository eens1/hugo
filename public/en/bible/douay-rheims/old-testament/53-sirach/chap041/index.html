<h1>Chapter 41</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions!</p>
<p>2 To a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!</p>
<p>3 O death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need, and to him whose strength faileth:</p>
<p>4 Who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that loseth patience!</p>
<p>5 Fear not the sentence of death. Remember what things have been before thee, and what shall come after thee: this sentence is from the Lord upon all flesh.</p>
<p>6 And what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most High? whether ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years.</p>
<p>7 For among the dead there is no accusing of life.</p>
<p>8 The children of sinners become children of abominations, and they that converse near the houses of the ungodly.</p>
<p>9 The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p>10 The children will complain of an ungodly father, because for his sake they are in reproach.</p>
<p>11 Woe to you, ungodly men, who have forsaken the law of the most high Lord.</p>
<p>12 And if you be born, you shall be born in malediction: and if you die, in malediction shall be your portion.</p>
<p>13 All things that are of the earth, shall return into the earth: so the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction.</p>
<p>14 The mourning of men is about their body, but the name of the ungodly shall be blotted out.</p>
<p>15 Take care of a good name: for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand treasures precious and great.</p>
<p>16 A good life hath its number of days: but a good name shall continue for ever.</p>
<p>17 My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is there in them both?</p>
<p>18 Better is the man that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.</p>
<p>19 Wherefore have a shame of these things I am now going to speak of.</p>
<p>20 For it is not good to keep all shamefacedness: and all things do not please all men in opinion.</p>
<p>21 Be ashamed of fornication before father and mother: and of a lie before a governor and a man in power:</p>
<p>22 Of an offence before a prince, and a judge: of iniquity before a congregation and a people:</p>
<p>23 Of injustice before a companion and friend: and in regard to the place where thou dwellest,</p>
<p>24 Of theft, and of the truth of God, and the covenant: of leaning with thy elbow over meat, and of deceit in giving and taking:</p>
<p>25 Of silence before them that salute thee: of looking upon a harlot: and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman.</p>
<p>26 Turn not away thy face from thy neighbour, and of taking away a portion and not restoring.</p>
<p>27 Gaze not upon another man&rsquo;s wife, and be not inquisitive after his handmaid, and approach not her bed.</p>
<p>28 Be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends: and after thou hast given, upbraid not.</p>
