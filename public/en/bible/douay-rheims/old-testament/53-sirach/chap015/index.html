<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 He that feareth God, will do good: and he that possesseth justice, shall lay hold on her,</p>
<p>2 And she will meet him as an honourable mother, and will receive him as a wife married of a virgin.</p>
<p>3 With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved.</p>
<p>4 And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded: and she shall exalt him among his neighbours.</p>
<p>5 And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth, and shall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and shall clothe him with a robe of glory.</p>
<p>6 She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.</p>
<p>7 But foolish men shall not obtain her, and wise men shall meet her, foolish men shall not see her: for she is far from pride and deceit.</p>
<p>8 Lying men shall be mindful of her: but men that speak truth shall be found with her, and shall advance, even till they come to the sight of God.</p>
<p>9 Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner:</p>
<p>10 For wisdom came forth from God: for praise shall be with the wisdom of God, and shall abound in a faithful mouth, and the sovereign Lord will give praise unto it.</p>
<p>11 Say not: It is through God, that she is not with me: for do not thou the things that he hateth.</p>
<p>12 Say not: He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of wicked men.</p>
<p>13 The Lord hateth all abomination of error, and they that fear him shall not love it.</p>
<p>14 God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel.</p>
<p>15 He added his commandments and precepts.</p>
<p>16 If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable fidelity for ever, they shall preserve thee.</p>
<p>17 He hath set water and fire before thee: stretch forth thy hand to which thou wilt.</p>
<p>18 Before man is life and death, good and evil, that which he shall choose shall be given him:</p>
<p>19 For the wisdom of God is great, and he is strong in power, seeing all men without ceasing.</p>
<p>20 The eyes of the Lord are towards them that fear him, and he knoweth al the work of man.</p>
<p>21 He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, and he hath given no man license to sin;</p>
<p>22 For he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable children.</p>
