<h1>Chapter 32</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Have they made thee ruler? be not lifted up: be among them as one of them.</p>
<p>2 Have care of them, and so sit down, and when thou hast acquitted thyself of all thy charge, take thy place:</p>
<p>3 That thou mayst rejoice for them, and receive a crown as an ornament of grace, and get the honour of the contribution.</p>
<p>4 Speak, thou that art elder: for it becometh thee,</p>
<p>5 To speak the first word with careful knowledge, and hinder not music.</p>
<p>6 Where there is no hearing, pour not out words, and be not lifted up out of season with thy wisdom.</p>
<p>7 A concert of music in a banquet of wine is as a carbuncle set in gold.</p>
<p>8 As a signet of an emerald in a work of gold: so is the melody of music with pleasant and moderate wine.</p>
<p>9 Hear in silence, and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.</p>
<p>10 Young man, scarcely speak in thy own cause.</p>
<p>11 If thou be asked twice, let thy answer be short.</p>
<p>12 In many things be as if thou wert ignorant, and hear in silence and withal seeking.</p>
<p>13 In the company of great men take not upon thee: and when the ancients are present, speak not much.</p>
<p>14 Before a storm goeth lightning: and before shamefacedness goeth favour: and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.</p>
<p>15 And at the time of rising be not slack: but be first to run home to thy house, and there withdraw thyself, and there take thy pastime.</p>
<p>16 And do what thou hast a mind, but not in sin or proud speech.</p>
<p>17 And for all these things bless the Lord, that made thee, and that replenisheth thee with all his good things.</p>
<p>18 He that feareth the Lord, will receive his discipline: and they that will seek him early, shall find a blessing.</p>
<p>19 He that seeketh the law, shall be filled with it: and he that dealeth deceitfully, shall meet with a stumblingblock therein.</p>
<p>20 They that fear the Lord, shall find just judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.</p>
<p>21 A sinful man will flee reproof, and will find an excuse according to his will.</p>
<p>22 A man of counsel will not neglect understanding, a strange and proud man will not dread fear:</p>
<p>23 Even after he hath done with fear without counsel, he shall be controlled by the things of his own seeking.</p>
<p>24 My son, do thou nothing without counsel, and thou shalt not repent when thou hast done.</p>
<p>25 Go not in the way of ruin, and thou shalt not stumble against the stones: trust not thyself to a rugged way, lest thou set a stumblingblock to thy soul.</p>
<p>26 And beware of thy own children, and take heed of them of thy household.</p>
<p>27 In every work of thine regard thy soul in faith: for this is the keeping of the commandments.</p>
<p>28 He that believeth God, taketh heed to the commandments: and he that trusteth in him, shall fare never the worse.</p>
