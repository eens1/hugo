<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.</p>
<p>2 Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.</p>
<p>3 Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to gibe to him that is in distress.</p>
<p>4 Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.</p>
<p>5 Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.</p>
<p>6 For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.</p>
<p>7 Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.</p>
<p>8 Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.</p>
<p>9 Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.</p>
<p>10 In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.</p>
<p>11 And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.</p>
<p>12 Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.</p>
<p>13 And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness.</p>
<p>14 They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.</p>
<p>15 They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.</p>
<p>16 He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.</p>
<p>17 If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.</p>
<p>18 For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.</p>
<p>19 She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.</p>
<p>20 Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,</p>
<p>21 And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.</p>
<p>22 But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.</p>
<p>23 Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.</p>
<p>24 For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.</p>
<p>25 For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.</p>
<p>26 Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.</p>
<p>27 Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:</p>
<p>28 And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.</p>
<p>29 For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.</p>
<p>30 In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.</p>
<p>31 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.</p>
<p>32 Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river.</p>
<p>33 Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.</p>
<p>34 Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.</p>
<p>35 Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.</p>
<p>36 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.</p>
