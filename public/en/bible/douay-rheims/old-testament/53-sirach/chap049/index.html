<h1>Chapter 49</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made by the art of a perfumer:</p>
<p>2 His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine.</p>
<p>3 He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of wickedness.</p>
<p>4 And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened godliness.</p>
<p>5 Except David, and Ezechias and Josias, all committed sin.</p>
<p>6 For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God.</p>
<p>7 So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation,</p>
<p>8 They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias.</p>
<p>9 For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet from his mother&rsquo;s womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew.</p>
<p>10 It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.</p>
<p>11 For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.</p>
<p>12 And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place: for they strengthened Jacob, and redeemed themselves by strong faith.</p>
<p>13 How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on the right hand;</p>
<p>14 In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory.</p>
<p>15 And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses.</p>
<p>16 No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was taken up from the earth.</p>
<p>17 Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people:</p>
<p>18 And his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied.</p>
<p>19 Seth and Sem obtained glory among men: and above every soul Adam in the beginning,</p>
