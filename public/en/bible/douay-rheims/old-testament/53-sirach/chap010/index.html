<h1>Chapter 10</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A wise judge shall judge his people, and the government of a prudent man shall be steady.</p>
<p>2 As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers: and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such also are they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>3 An unwise king shall be the ruin of his people: and cities shall be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers.</p>
<p>4 The power of the earth is in the hand of God, and in his time he will raise up a profitable ruler over it.</p>
<p>5 The prosperity of man is in the hand of God, and upon the person of the scribe he shall lay his honour.</p>
<p>6 Remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour, and do thou nothing by deeds of injury.</p>
<p>7 Pride is hateful before God and men: and all iniquity of nations is execrable.</p>
<p>8 A kingdom is translated from one people to another, because of injustices, and wrongs, and injuries, and divers deceits.</p>
<p>9 But nothing is more wicked than the covetous man. Why is earth, and ashes proud?</p>
<p>10 There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he liveth he hath cast away his bowels.</p>
<p>11 All power is of short life. A long sickness is troublesome to the physician.</p>
<p>12 The physician cutteth off a short sickness: so also a king is to day, and to morrow he shall die.</p>
<p>13 For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.</p>
<p>14 The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:</p>
<p>15 Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: he that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.</p>
<p>16 Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.</p>
<p>17 God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set up the meek in their stead.</p>
<p>18 God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and hath planted the humble of these nations.</p>
<p>19 The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and hath destroyed them even to the foundation.</p>
<p>20 He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth.</p>
<p>21 God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.</p>
<p>22 Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of women.</p>
<p>23 That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God: but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p>24 In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable: so shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.</p>
<p>25 The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the honourable, and of the poor.</p>
<p>26 Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a sinful man that is rich.</p>
<p>27 The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth God.</p>
<p>28 They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise: and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be honoured.</p>
<p>29 Extol not thyself in doing thy work, and linger not in the time of distress;</p>
<p>30 Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread.</p>
<p>31 My son, keep thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to its desert.</p>
<p>32 Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul?</p>
<p>33 The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear, and there is a man that is honoured for his wealth.</p>
<p>34 But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth? and he that is glorified in wealth, let him fear poverty.</p>
