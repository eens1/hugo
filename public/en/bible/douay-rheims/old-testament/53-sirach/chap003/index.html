<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.</p>
<p>2 Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.</p>
<p>3 For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.</p>
<p>4 He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.</p>
<p>5 And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.</p>
<p>6 He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.</p>
<p>7 He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.</p>
<p>8 He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.</p>
<p>9 Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,</p>
<p>10 That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.</p>
<p>11 The father&rsquo;s blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother&rsquo;s curse rooteth up the foundation.</p>
<p>12 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.</p>
<p>13 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.</p>
<p>14 Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;</p>
<p>15 And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p>16 For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.</p>
<p>17 And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sins shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.</p>
<p>18 Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.</p>
<p>19 My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.</p>
<p>20 The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:</p>
<p>21 For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.</p>
<p>22 Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.</p>
<p>23 For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.</p>
<p>24 In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.</p>
<p>25 For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.</p>
<p>26 And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.</p>
<p>27 A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.</p>
<p>28 A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.</p>
<p>29 A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.</p>
<p>30 The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.</p>
<p>31 The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.</p>
<p>32 A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.</p>
<p>33 Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:</p>
<p>34 And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.</p>
