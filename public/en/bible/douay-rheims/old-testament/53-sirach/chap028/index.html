<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.</p>
<p>2 Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurt thee: and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest.</p>
<p>3 Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God?</p>
<p>4 He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins?</p>
<p>5 He that is but flesh, nourisheth anger, and doth he ask forgiveness of God? who shall obtain pardon for his sins?</p>
<p>6 Remember thy last things, and let enmity cease:</p>
<p>7 For corruption and death hang over in his commandments.</p>
<p>8 Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour.</p>
<p>9 Remember the covenant of the most High, and overlook the ignorance of thy neighbour.</p>
<p>10 Refrain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins.</p>
<p>11 For a passionate man kindleth strife, and a sinful man will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the midst of them that are at peace.</p>
<p>12 For as the wood of the forest is, so the fire burneth, and as a man&rsquo;s strength is, so shall his anger be, and according to his riches he shall increase his anger.</p>
<p>13 A hasty contention kindleth a fire and a hasty quarrel sheddeth blood and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death.</p>
<p>14 If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire: and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: both come out of the mouth.</p>
<p>15 The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed: for he hath troubled many that were at peace.</p>
<p>16 The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many, and scattered them from nation to nation.</p>
<p>17 It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich, and hath overthrown the houses of great men.</p>
<p>18 It hath cut in pieces the forces of people, and undone strong nations.</p>
<p>19 The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women, and deprived them of their labours.</p>
<p>20 He that hearkeneth to it, shall never have rest, neither shall he have a friend in whom he may repose.</p>
<p>21 The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones.</p>
<p>22 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have perished by their own tongue.</p>
<p>23 Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue, that hath not passed into the wrath thereof, and that hath not drawn the yoke thereof, and hath not been bound in its bands.</p>
<p>24 For its yoke is a yoke of iron: and its bands are bands of brass.</p>
<p>25 The death thereof is a most evil death: and hell is preferable to it.</p>
<p>26 Its continuance shall not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its flame.</p>
<p>27 They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it shall tear them.</p>
<p>28 Hedge in thy ears with thorns, hear not a wicked tongue, and make doors and bars to thy mouth.</p>
<p>29 Melt down thy gold and silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a just bridle for thy mouth:</p>
<p>30 And take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue, and fall in the sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be incurable unto death.</p>
