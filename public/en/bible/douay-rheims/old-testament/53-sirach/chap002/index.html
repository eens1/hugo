<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.</p>
<p>2 Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.</p>
<p>3 Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.</p>
<p>4 Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.</p>
<p>5 For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.</p>
<p>6 Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein.</p>
<p>7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him lest ye fall.</p>
<p>8 Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.</p>
<p>9 Ye that fear the Lord hope in him, and mercy shall come to you for your delight.</p>
<p>10 Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.</p>
<p>11 My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.</p>
<p>12 For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?</p>
<p>13 For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth.</p>
<p>14 Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways.</p>
<p>15 Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him.</p>
<p>16 Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.</p>
<p>17 And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?</p>
<p>18 They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.</p>
<p>19 They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.</p>
<p>20 They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls,</p>
<p>21 They that fear the Lord, keep his commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,</p>
<p>22 Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</p>
<p>23 For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.</p>
