<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Do no evils, and no evils shall lay hold of thee.</p>
<p>2 Depart from the unjust, and evils shall depart from thee.</p>
<p>3 My son, sow not evils in the furrows of injustice, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold.</p>
<p>4 Seek not of the Lord a preeminence, nor of the king the seat of honour.</p>
<p>5 Justify not thyself before God, for he knoweth the heart: and desire not to appear wise before the king.</p>
<p>6 Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities: lest thou fear the person of the powerful, and lay a stumblingblock for thy integrity.</p>
<p>7 Offend not against the multitude of a city, neither cast thyself in upon the people,</p>
<p>8 Nor bind sin to sin: for even in one thou shalt not be unpunished.</p>
<p>9 Be not fainthearted in thy mind:</p>
<p>10 Neglect not to pray, and to give alms.</p>
<p>11 Say not: God will have respect to the multitude of my gifts, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept my offerings.</p>
<p>12 Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one that humbleth and exalteth, God who seeth all.</p>
<p>13 Devise not a lie against thy brother: neither do the like against thy friend.</p>
<p>14 Be not willing to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good.</p>
<p>15 Be not full of words in a multitude of ancients, and repeat not the word in thy prayer.</p>
<p>16 Hate not laborious works, nor husbandry ordained by the most High.</p>
<p>17 Number not thyself among the multitude of the disorderly.</p>
<p>18 Remember wrath, for it will not tarry long.</p>
<p>19 Humble thy spirit very much: for the vengeance on the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms.</p>
<p>20 Do not transgress against thy friend deferring money, nor despise thy dear brother for the sake of gold.</p>
<p>21 Depart not from a wise and good wife, whom thou hast gotten in the fear of the Lord: for the grace of her modesty is above gold.</p>
<p>22 Hurt not the servant that worketh faithfully, nor the hired man that giveth thee his life.</p>
<p>23 Let a wise servant be dear to thee as thy own soul, defraud him not of liberty, nor leave him needy.</p>
<p>24 Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee.</p>
<p>25 Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their childhood.</p>
<p>26 Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thy countenance gay towards them.</p>
<p>27 Marry thy daughter well, and thou shalt do a great work, and give her to a wise man.</p>
<p>28 If thou hast a wife according to thy soul, cast her not off: and to her that is hateful, trust not thyself. With thy whole heart,</p>
<p>29 Honour thy father, and forget not the groanings of thy mother:</p>
<p>30 Remember that thou hadst not been born but through them: and make a return to them as they have done for thee.</p>
<p>31 With all thy soul fear the Lord, and reverence his priests.</p>
<p>32 With all thy strength love him that made thee: and forsake not his ministers.</p>
<p>33 Honour God with all thy soul and give honour to the priests, and purify thyself with thy arms.</p>
<p>34 Give them their portion, as it is commanded thee, of the firstfruits and of purifications: and for thy negligences purify thyself with a few.</p>
<p>35 Offer to the Lord the gift of thy shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things:</p>
<p>36 And stretch out thy hand to the poor, that thy expiation and thy blessing may be perfected.</p>
<p>37 A gift hath grace in the sight of all the living, and restrain not grace from the dead.</p>
<p>38 Be not wanting in comforting them that weep, and walk with them that mourn.</p>
<p>39 Be not slow to visit the sick: for by these things thou shalt be confirmed in love.</p>
<p>40 In all thy works remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.</p>
