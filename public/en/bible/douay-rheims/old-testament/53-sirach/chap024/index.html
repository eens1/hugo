<h1>Chapter 24</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,</p>
<p>2 And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his power,</p>
<p>3 And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted, and shall be admired in the holy assembly.</p>
<p>4 And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:</p>
<p>5 I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:</p>
<p>6 I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:</p>
<p>7 I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.</p>
<p>8 I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,</p>
<p>9 And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,</p>
<p>10 And in every nation I have had the chief rule:</p>
<p>11 And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.</p>
<p>12 Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,</p>
<p>13 And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.</p>
<p>14 From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.</p>
<p>15 And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>16 And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.</p>
<p>17 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.</p>
<p>18 I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:</p>
<p>19 As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.</p>
<p>20 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon, and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:</p>
<p>21 And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.</p>
<p>22 I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.</p>
<p>23 As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.</p>
<p>24 I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.</p>
<p>25 In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.</p>
<p>26 Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.</p>
<p>27 For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p>28 My memory is unto everlasting generations.</p>
<p>29 They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.</p>
<p>30 He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.</p>
<p>31 They that explain me shall have life everlasting.</p>
<p>32 All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.</p>
<p>33 Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.</p>
<p>34 He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.</p>
<p>35 Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in the days of the new fruits.</p>
<p>36 Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.</p>
<p>37 Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as Gehon in the time of the vintage.</p>
<p>38 Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker shall not search her out.</p>
<p>39 For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.</p>
<p>40 I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.</p>
<p>41 I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river, and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.</p>
<p>42 I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.</p>
<p>43 And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:</p>
<p>44 For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.</p>
<p>45 I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.</p>
<p>46 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.</p>
<p>47 See ye that I have not laboured myself only, but for all that seek out the truth.</p>
