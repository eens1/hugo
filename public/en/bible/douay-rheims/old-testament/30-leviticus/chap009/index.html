<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when the eighth day was come, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the ancients of Israel, and said to Aaron:</p>
<p>2 Take of the herd a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.</p>
<p>3 And to the children of Israel thou shalt say: Take ye a he goat for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year old, and without blemish for a holocaust.</p>
<p>4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings. And immolate them before the Lord, offering for the sacrifice of every one of them flour tempered with oil: for to day the Lord will appear to you.</p>
<p>5 They brought therefore all things that Moses had commanded before the door of the tabernacle: where when all the multitude stood,</p>
<p>6 Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded. Do it, and his glory will appear to you.</p>
<p>7 And he said to Aaron: Approach to the altar, and offer sacrifice for thy sin. Offer the holocaust, and pray for thyself and for the people: and when thou hast slain the people&rsquo;s victim, pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.</p>
<p>8 And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated the calf for his sin.</p>
<p>9 And his sons brought him the blood of it: and he dipped his finger therein, and touched the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the foot thereof.</p>
<p>10 And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>11 But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
<p>12 He immolated also the victim of holocaust: and his sons brought him the blood thereof, which he poured round about on the altar.</p>
<p>13 And the victim being cut into pieces, they brought to him the head and all the members: all which he burnt with fire upon the altar.</p>
<p>14 Having first washed the entrails and the feet with water.</p>
<p>15 Then offering for the sin of the people, he slew the he goat: and expiating the altar,</p>
<p>16 He offered the holocaust.</p>
<p>17 Adding in the sacrifice the libations, which are offered withal, and burning them upon the altar, besides the ceremonies of the morning holocaust.</p>
<p>18 He immolated also the bullock and the ram, and peace offerings of the people: and his sons brought him the blood, which he poured upon the altar round about.</p>
<p>19 The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and the two little kidneys with their fat, and the caul of the liver,</p>
<p>20 They put upon the breasts. And after the fat was burnt upon the altar,</p>
<p>21 Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.</p>
<p>22 And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.</p>
<p>23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude.</p>
<p>24 And, behold, a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.</p>
