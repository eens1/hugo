<h1>Chapter 21</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The Lord said also to Moses: Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say for them: Let not a priest incur an uncleanness at the death of his citizens.</p>
<p>2 But only for his kin, such as are near in blood: that is to say, for his father and for his mother, and for his son, and for his daughter, for his brother also:</p>
<p>3 And for a maiden sister, who hath had no husband.</p>
<p>4 But not even for the prince of his people shall he do any thing that may make him unclean.</p>
<p>5 Neither shall they shave their head, nor their beard, nor make incisions in their flesh.</p>
<p>6 They shall be holy to their God, and shall not profane his name. For they offer the burnt offering of the Lord, and the bread of their God: and therefore they shall be holy.</p>
<p>7 They shall not take to wife a harlot or a vile prostitute, nor one that has been put away from her husband: because they are consecrated to their God,</p>
<p>8 And offer the loaves of proposition. Let them therefore be holy because I also am holy: the Lord, who sanctify them.</p>
<p>9 If the daughter of a priest be taken in whoredom and dishonour the name of her father, she shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p>10 The high priest, that is to say, the priest who is the greatest among his brethren, upon whose head the oil of unction hath been poured; and whose hands have been consecrated for the priesthood; and who hath been vested with the holy vestments. He shall not uncover his head: he shall not rend his garments.</p>
<p>11 Nor shall he go in at all to any dead person: not even for his father, or his mother, shall he be defiled.</p>
<p>12 Neither shall he go out of the holy places, lest he defile the sanctuary of the Lord: because the oil of the holy unction of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.</p>
<p>13 He shall take a virgin unto his wife.</p>
<p>14 But a widow or one that is divorced, or defied, or a harlot, he shall not take: but a maid of his own people.</p>
<p>15 He shall not mingle the stock of his kindred with the common people of this nation: for I am the Lord who sanctify him.</p>
<p>16 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>17 Say to Aaron: Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his God.</p>
<p>18 Neither shall he approach to minister to him: If he be blind; if he be lame; if he have a little, or a great, or a crooked nose;</p>
<p>19 If his foot, or if his hand be broken;</p>
<p>20 If he be crookbacked; or blear eyed; or have a pearl in his eye, or a continual scab, or a dry scurf in his body, or a rupture.</p>
<p>21 Whosoever of the seed of Aaron the priest hath a blemish: he shall not approach to offer sacrifices to the Lord, nor bread to his God.</p>
<p>22 He shall eat nevertheless of the loaves that are offered in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>23 Yet so that he enter not within the veil, nor approach to the altar: because he hath a blemish, and he must not defile my sanctuary. I am the Lord who sanctify them.</p>
<p>24 Moses, therefore spoke to Aaron, and to his sons and to all Israel, all the things that had been commanded him.</p>
