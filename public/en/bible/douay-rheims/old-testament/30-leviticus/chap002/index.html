<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour: and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,</p>
<p>2 And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests. And one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense; and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
<p>3 And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron&rsquo;s, and his sons&rsquo;, holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</p>
<p>4 But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:</p>
<p>5 If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven:</p>
<p>6 Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.</p>
<p>7 And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil.</p>
<p>8 And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.</p>
<p>9 And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
<p>10 And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron&rsquo;s, and his sons&rsquo;: holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven: neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
<p>12 You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts: but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness.</p>
<p>13 Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt: neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.</p>
<p>14 But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal; and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord:</p>
<p>15 Pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense, because it is the oblation of the Lord.</p>
<p>16 Whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift, part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and all the frankincense.</p>
