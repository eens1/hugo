<h1>Chapter 39</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 In the ninth year of Sedecias king of Juda, in the tenth month, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army to Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p>
<p>2 And in the eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.</p>
<p>3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>4 And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king&rsquo;s garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went out to the way of the desert.</p>
<p>5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them: and they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho, and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judgment upon him.</p>
<p>6 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes: and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda.</p>
<p>7 He also put out the eyes of Sedecias: and bound him with fetters, to be carried to Babylon.</p>
<p>8 And the Chaldeans burnt the king&rsquo;s house, and the houses of the people with fire, and they threw down the wall of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9 And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.</p>
<p>10 But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had nothing at all, in the land of Juda, and he gave them vineyards, and cisterns at that time.</p>
<p>11 Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremiah, saying:</p>
<p>12 Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm: but as he hath a mind, so do with him.</p>
<p>13 Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabuzardan, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the king of Babylon,</p>
<p>14 Sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, that he might go home, and dwell among the people.</p>
<p>15 But the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, when he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Go, and tell Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:</p>
<p>16 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good: and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day.</p>
<p>17 And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest:</p>
<p>18 But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword: but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.</p>
