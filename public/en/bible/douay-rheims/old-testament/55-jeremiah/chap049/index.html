<h1>Chapter 49</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities?</p>
<p>2 Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>3 Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.</p>
<p>4 Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?</p>
<p>5 Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another&rsquo;s sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.</p>
<p>6 And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>7 Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable.</p>
<p>8 Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation.</p>
<p>9 If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them.</p>
<p>10 But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be.</p>
<p>11 Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me.</p>
<p>12 For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink.</p>
<p>13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.</p>
<p>14 I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle.</p>
<p>15 For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men.</p>
<p>16 Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill: but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>17 And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.</p>
<p>18 As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it.</p>
<p>19 Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?</p>
<p>20 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.</p>
<p>21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>22 Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.</p>
<p>23 Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care they could not rest.</p>
<p>24 Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour.</p>
<p>25 How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy!</p>
<p>26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.</p>
<p>28 Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east.</p>
<p>29 They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round about.</p>
<p>30 Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asor, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.</p>
<p>31 Arise, and go up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone.</p>
<p>32 And their camels shall be for a spoil and the multitude of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from all their confines, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>33 And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.</p>
<p>34 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying:</p>
<p>35 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength.</p>
<p>36 And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.</p>
<p>37 And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord: and I will send the sword after them, till I consume them.</p>
<p>38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>39 But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam, to return, saith the Lord.</p>
