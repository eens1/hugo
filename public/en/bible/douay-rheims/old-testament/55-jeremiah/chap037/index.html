<h1>Chapter 37</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned instead of Jechonias the son of Joakim: whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon made king in the land of Juda.</p>
<p>2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p>3 And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: Pray to the Lord our God for us.</p>
<p>4 Now Jeremiah walked freely in the midst of the people: for they had not as yet cast him into prison. And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>5 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.</p>
<p>7 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</p>
<p>8 Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away.</p>
<p>9 But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his heart, and burn this city with fire.</p>
<p>10 Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao&rsquo;s army,</p>
<p>11 Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens,</p>
<p>12 And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.</p>
<p>13 And Jeremiah answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.</p>
<p>14 Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.</p>
<p>15 So Jeremiah went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained there many days.</p>
<p>16 Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah said. There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>17 And Jeremiah said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?</p>
<p>18 Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?</p>
<p>19 Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</p>
<p>20 Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremiah should be committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremiah remained in the entry of the prison.</p>
