<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,</p>
<p>2 And he said:</p>
<p>3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</p>
<p>4 Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</p>
<p>5 Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</p>
<p>6 Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</p>
<p>7 Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</p>
<p>8 Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</p>
<p>9 Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</p>
<p>10 Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</p>
<p>11 Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p>12 Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?</p>
<p>13 For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:</p>
<p>14 With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</p>
<p>15 Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:</p>
<p>16 Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.</p>
<p>17 There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</p>
<p>18 And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p>19 The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p>20 Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?</p>
<p>21 That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</p>
<p>22 And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?</p>
<p>23 To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?</p>
<p>24 Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</p>
<p>25 For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</p>
<p>26 Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</p>
