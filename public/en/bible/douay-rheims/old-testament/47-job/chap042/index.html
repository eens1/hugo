<h1>Chapter 42</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered the Lord, and said:</p>
<p>2 I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.</p>
<p>3 Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</p>
<p>4 Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</p>
<p>5 With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</p>
<p>6 Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.</p>
<p>7 And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant Job hath.</p>
<p>8 Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job shall pray for you: his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</p>
<p>9 So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</p>
<p>10 The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p>11 And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.</p>
<p>12 And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
<p>13 And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</p>
<p>14 And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii.</p>
<p>15 And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
<p>16 And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children&rsquo;s children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</p>
