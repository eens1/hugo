<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<p>1 I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.</p>
<p>2 For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p>3 Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?</p>
<p>4 Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?</p>
<p>5 If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</p>
<p>6 Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</p>
<p>7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:</p>
<p>8 Then let me sow and let another reap: and let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p>9 If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend&rsquo;s door:</p>
<p>10 Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.</p>
<p>11 For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.</p>
<p>12 It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.</p>
<p>13 If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:</p>
<p>14 For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p>15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?</p>
<p>16 If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:</p>
<p>17 If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:</p>
<p>18 (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother&rsquo;s womb:)</p>
<p>19 If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:</p>
<p>20 If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</p>
<p>21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:</p>
<p>22 Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.</p>
<p>23 For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was unable to bear.</p>
<p>24 If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:</p>
<p>25 If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.</p>
<p>26 If I beheld the sun when it shined and the moon going in brightness:</p>
<p>27 And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:</p>
<p>28 Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.</p>
<p>29 If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.</p>
<p>30 For I have not been given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p>31 If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?</p>
<p>32 The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.</p>
<p>33 If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.</p>
<p>34 If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.</p>
<p>35 Who would grant me a hearing, that the Almighty may hear my desire: and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,</p>
<p>36 That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?</p>
<p>37 At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.</p>
<p>38 If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:</p>
<p>39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the son of the tillers thereof:</p>
<p>40 Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.</p>
