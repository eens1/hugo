<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Eliphaz the Themanite, answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and fill his stomach with burning heat?</p>
<p>3 Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou speakest that which is not good for thee.</p>
<p>4 As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken away prayers from before God.</p>
<p>5 For thy iniquity hath taught thy mouth, and thou imitatest the tongue of blasphemers.</p>
<p>6 Thy own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I: and thy own lips shall answer thee.</p>
<p>7 Art thou the first man that was born, or wast thou made before the hills?</p>
<p>8 Hast thou heard God&rsquo;s counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior to thee?</p>
<p>9 What knowest thou that we are ignorant of? what dost thou understand that we know not?</p>
<p>10 There are with us also aged and ancient men, much elder than thy fathers.</p>
<p>11 Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee? but thy wicked words hinder this.</p>
<p>12 Why doth thy heart elevate thee, and why dost thou stare with thy eyes, as if they were thinking great things?</p>
<p>13 Why doth thy spirit swell against God, to utter such words out of thy mouth?</p>
<p>14 What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just?</p>
<p>15 Behold among his saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in his sight.</p>
<p>16 How much more is man abominable, and unprofitable, who drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
<p>17 I will shew thee, hear me: and I will tell thee what I have seen.</p>
<p>18 Wise men confess and hide not their fathers.</p>
<p>19 To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger hath passed among them.</p>
<p>20 The wicked man is proud all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.</p>
<p>21 The sound of dread is always in his ears: and when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason.</p>
<p>22 He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light, looking round about for the sword on every side.</p>
<p>23 When he moveth himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p>24 Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him, as a king that is prepared for the battle.</p>
<p>25 For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath strengthened himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p>26 He hath run against him with his neck raised up, and is armed with a fat neck.</p>
<p>27 Fatness hath covered his face, and the fat hangeth down on his sides.</p>
<p>28 He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in desert houses that are reduced into heaps.</p>
<p>29 He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he push his root in the earth.</p>
<p>30 He shall not depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his branches, and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own mouth.</p>
<p>31 He shall not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he may be redeemed with any price.</p>
<p>32 Before his days be full he shall perish: and his hands shall wither away.</p>
<p>33 He shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first flower, and as an olive tree that casteth its flower.</p>
<p>34 For the congregation of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shall devour their tabernacles, who love to take bribes.</p>
<p>35 He hath conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepareth deceits.</p>
