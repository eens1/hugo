<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Behold my eye hath seen all these things, and my ear hath heard them, and I have understood them all.</p>
<p>2 According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.</p>
<p>3 But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p>4 Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.</p>
<p>5 And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men.</p>
<p>6 Hear ye therefore my reproof, and attend to the judgment of my lips.</p>
<p>7 Hath God any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for him?</p>
<p>8 Do you accept this person, and do you endeavour to judge for God?</p>
<p>9 Or shall it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed? or shall he be deceived as a man, with your deceitful dealings?</p>
<p>10 He shall reprove you, because in secret you accept his person.</p>
<p>11 As soon as he shall move himself, he shall trouble you: and his dread shall fall upon you.</p>
<p>12 Your remembrance shall be compared to ashes, and your necks shall be brought to clay.</p>
<p>13 Hold your peace a little while, that I may speak whatsoever my mind shall suggest to me.</p>
<p>14 Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?</p>
<p>15 Although he should kill me, I will trust in him: but yet I will reprove my ways in his sight.</p>
<p>16 And he shall be my saviour: for no hypocrite shall come before his presence.</p>
<p>17 Hear ye my speech, and receive with your ears hidden truths.</p>
<p>18 If I shall be judged, I know that I shall be found just.</p>
<p>19 Who is he that will plead against me? let him come: why am I consumed holding my peace?</p>
<p>20 Two things only do not to me, and then from thy face I shall not be hid:</p>
<p>21 Withdraw thy hand far from me, and let not thy dread terrify me.</p>
<p>22 Call me, and I will answer thee: or else I will speak, and do thou answer me.</p>
<p>23 How many are my iniquities and sins? make me know my crimes and offenses.</p>
<p>24 Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thy enemy?</p>
<p>25 Against a leaf, that is carried away with the wind, thou shewest thy power, and thou pursuest a dry straw.</p>
<p>26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and wilt consume me for the sins of my youth.</p>
<p>27 Thou hast put my feet in the stocks, and hast observed all my paths, and hast considered the steps of my feet:</p>
<p>28 Who am to be consumed as rottenness, and as a garment that is motheaten.</p>
