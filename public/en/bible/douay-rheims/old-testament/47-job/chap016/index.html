<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 I have often heard such things as these: you are all troublesome comforters.</p>
<p>3 Shall windy words have no end? or is it any trouble to thee to speak?</p>
<p>4 I also could speak like you: and would God your soul were for my soul.</p>
<p>5 I would comfort you also with words, and would wag my head over you.</p>
<p>6 I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you.</p>
<p>7 But what shall I do? If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me.</p>
<p>8 But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, and all my limbs are brought to nothing.</p>
<p>9 My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.</p>
<p>10 He hath gathered together his fury against me, and threatening me he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me: my enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes.</p>
<p>11 They have opened their mouths upon me, and reproaching me they have struck me on the cheek, they are filled with my pains.</p>
<p>12 God hath shut me up with the unjust man, and hath delivered me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p>13 I that was formerly so wealthy, am all on a sudden broken to pieces: he hath taken me by my neck, he hath broken me, and hath set me up to be his mark.</p>
<p>14 He hath compassed me round about with his lances, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out my bowels on the earth,</p>
<p>15 He hath torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a giant.</p>
<p>16 I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes.</p>
<p>17 My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyelids are dim.</p>
<p>18 These things have I suffered without the iniquity of my hand, when I offered pure prayers to God.</p>
<p>19 O earth, cover not thou my blood, neither let my cry find a hiding place in thee.</p>
<p>20 For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that knoweth my conscience is on high.</p>
<p>21 My friends are full of words: my eye poureth out tears to God.</p>
<p>22 And O that a man might so be judged with God, as the son of man is judged with his companion!</p>
<p>23 For behold short years pass away, and I am walking in a path by which I shall not return.</p>
