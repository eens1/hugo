<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?</p>
<p>3 Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:</p>
<p>4 Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:</p>
<p>5 But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p>6 Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?</p>
<p>7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?</p>
<p>8 On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,</p>
<p>9 Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.</p>
<p>10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:</p>
<p>11 The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.</p>
<p>12 Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.</p>
<p>13 In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,</p>
<p>14 Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:</p>
<p>15 And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.</p>
<p>16 There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.</p>
<p>17 Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
<p>18 Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:</p>
<p>19 How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?</p>
<p>20 From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.</p>
<p>21 And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom.</p>
