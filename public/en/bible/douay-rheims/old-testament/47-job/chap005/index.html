<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.</p>
<p>2 Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.</p>
<p>3 I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.</p>
<p>4 His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.</p>
<p>5 Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.</p>
<p>6 Nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.</p>
<p>7 Man is born to labour, and the bird to fly.</p>
<p>8 Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:</p>
<p>9 Who doth great things, and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:</p>
<p>10 Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:</p>
<p>11 Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.</p>
<p>12 Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:</p>
<p>13 Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:</p>
<p>14 They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
<p>15 But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</p>
<p>16 And to the needy there shall be hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.</p>
<p>17 Blessed is the man whom God correcteth: refuse not, therefore, the chastising of the Lord.</p>
<p>18 For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands shall heal.</p>
<p>19 In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.</p>
<p>20 In famine he shall deliver thee from death; and in battle, from the hand of the sword.</p>
<p>21 Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.</p>
<p>22 In destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>23 But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at peace with thee.</p>
<p>24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and visiting thy beauty, thou shalt not sin.</p>
<p>25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied, and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.</p>
<p>26 Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap of wheat is brought in its season.</p>
<p>27 Behold, this is even so, as we have searched out: which thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind.</p>
