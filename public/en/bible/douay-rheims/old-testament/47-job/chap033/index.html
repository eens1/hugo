<h1>Chapter 33</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p>2 Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.</p>
<p>3 My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.</p>
<p>4 The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</p>
<p>5 If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.</p>
<p>6 Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.</p>
<p>7 But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.</p>
<p>8 Now thou hast said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words:</p>
<p>9 I am clean, and without sin: I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me.</p>
<p>10 Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.</p>
<p>11 He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.</p>
<p>12 Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p>13 Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?</p>
<p>14 God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.</p>
<p>15 By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds:</p>
<p>16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.</p>
<p>17 That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.</p>
<p>18 Rescuing his soul from corruption: and his life from passing to the sword.</p>
<p>19 He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.</p>
<p>20 Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired.</p>
<p>21 His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.</p>
<p>22 His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p>23 If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man&rsquo;s uprightness,</p>
<p>24 He shall have mercy on him, and shall say: Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption: I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.</p>
<p>25 His flesh is consumed with punishments, let him return to the days of his youth.</p>
<p>26 He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him: and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.</p>
<p>27 He shall look upon men, and shall say: I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.</p>
<p>28 He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.</p>
<p>29 Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one.</p>
<p>30 That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.</p>
<p>31 Attend, Job, and hearken to me, and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.</p>
<p>32 But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak: for I would have thee to appear just.</p>
<p>33 And if thou have not, hear me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>
