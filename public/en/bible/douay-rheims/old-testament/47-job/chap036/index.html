<h1>Chapter 36</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Eliu also proceeded, and said:</p>
<p>2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to speak in God&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>3 I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.</p>
<p>4 For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.</p>
<p>5 God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.</p>
<p>6 But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.</p>
<p>7 He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p>8 And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty:</p>
<p>9 He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.</p>
<p>10 He also shall open their ear, to correct them: and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.</p>
<p>11 If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory.</p>
<p>12 But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.</p>
<p>13 Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.</p>
<p>14 Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.</p>
<p>15 He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction.</p>
<p>16 Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it: and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.</p>
<p>17 Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.</p>
<p>18 Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man: neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.</p>
<p>19 Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength.</p>
<p>20 Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.</p>
<p>21 Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity: for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.</p>
<p>22 Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.</p>
<p>23 Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him: Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>
<p>24 Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which men have sung.</p>
<p>25 All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off.</p>
<p>26 Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge: the number of his years is inestimable.</p>
<p>27 He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods:</p>
<p>28 Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.</p>
<p>29 If he will spread out clouds as his tent,</p>
<p>30 And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea.</p>
<p>31 For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals.</p>
<p>32 In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.</p>
<p>33 He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it.</p>
