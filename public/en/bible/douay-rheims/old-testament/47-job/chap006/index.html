<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 But Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.</p>
<p>3 As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:</p>
<p>4 For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.</p>
<p>5 Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?</p>
<p>6 Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which, when tasted, bringeth death?</p>
<p>7 The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.</p>
<p>8 Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?</p>
<p>9 And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?</p>
<p>10 And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy one.</p>
<p>11 For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end, that I should keep patience?</p>
<p>12 My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.</p>
<p>13 Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.</p>
<p>14 He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>15 My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.</p>
<p>16 They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.</p>
<p>17 At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot, they shall be melted out of their place.</p>
<p>18 The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.</p>
<p>19 Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.</p>
<p>20 They are confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.</p>
<p>21 Now you are come: and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.</p>
<p>22 Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?</p>
<p>23 Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p>24 Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant of any thing, instruct me.</p>
<p>25 Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?</p>
<p>26 You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.</p>
<p>27 You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.</p>
<p>28 However, finish what you have begun: give ear and see whether I lie.</p>
<p>29 Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.</p>
<p>30 And you shall not find iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.</p>
