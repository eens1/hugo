<h1>Chapter 34</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:</p>
<p>2 Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:</p>
<p>3 For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.</p>
<p>4 Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.</p>
<p>5 For Job hath said: I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.</p>
<p>6 For in judging me there is a lie: my arrow is violent without any sin.</p>
<p>7 What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p>8 Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?</p>
<p>9 For he hath said: Man shall not please God, although he run with him.</p>
<p>10 Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me: far from God be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.</p>
<p>11 For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.</p>
<p>12 For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p>13 What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?</p>
<p>14 If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.</p>
<p>15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.</p>
<p>16 If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p>17 Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?</p>
<p>18 Who saith to the king: Thou art an apostate: who calleth rulers ungodly:</p>
<p>19 Who accepteth not the persons of princes: nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man: for all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p>20 They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.</p>
<p>21 For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.</p>
<p>22 There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.</p>
<p>23 For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p>24 He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.</p>
<p>25 For he knoweth their works: and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>26 He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.</p>
<p>27 Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways:</p>
<p>28 So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.</p>
<p>29 For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</p>
<p>30 Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people.</p>
<p>31 Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</p>
<p>32 If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.</p>
<p>33 Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.</p>
<p>34 Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.</p>
<p>35 But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</p>
<p>36 My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the man of iniquity.</p>
<p>37 Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us: and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</p>
