<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Are you then men alone, and shall wisdom die with you?</p>
<p>3 I also have a heart as well as you: for who is ignorant of these things, which you know?</p>
<p>4 He that is mocked by his friends as I, shall call upon God and he will hear him: for the simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn.</p>
<p>5 The lamp despised in the thoughts of the rich, is ready for the time appointed.</p>
<p>6 The tabernacles of robbers abound, and they provoke God boldly; whereas it is he that hath given all into their hands:</p>
<p>7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee: and the birds of the air, and they shall tell thee.</p>
<p>8 Speak to the earth, and it shall answer thee: and the fishes of the sea shall tell.</p>
<p>9 Who is ignorant that the hand of the Lord hath made all these things?</p>
<p>10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man.</p>
<p>11 Doth not the ear discern words, and the palate of him that eateth, the taste?</p>
<p>12 In the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days prudence.</p>
<p>13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p>14 If he pull down, there is no man that can build up: if he shut up a man, there is none that can open.</p>
<p>15 If he withhold the waters, all things shall be dried up: and if he send them out, they shall overturn the earth.</p>
<p>16 With him is strength and wisdom: he knoweth both the deceivers, and him that is deceived.</p>
<p>17 He bringeth counsellors to a foolish end, and judges to insensibility.</p>
<p>18 He looseth the belt of kings, and girdeth their loins with a cord.</p>
<p>19 He leadeth away priests without glory, and overthroweth nobles.</p>
<p>20 He changeth the speech of the true speakers, and taketh away the doctrine of the aged.</p>
<p>21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and relieveth them that were oppressed.</p>
<p>22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth up to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p>23 He multiplieth nations, and destroyeth them, and restoreth them again after they were overthrown.</p>
<p>24 He changeth the heart of the princes of the people of the earth, and deceiveth them that they walk in vain where there is no way.</p>
<p>25 They shall grope as in the dark, and not in the light, and he shall make them stagger like men that are drunk.</p>
