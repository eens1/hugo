<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p>3 Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?</p>
<p>4 For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.</p>
<p>5 And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,</p>
<p>6 That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p>7 Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?</p>
<p>8 He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do? he is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know?</p>
<p>9 The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p>10 If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?</p>
<p>11 For he knoweth the vanity of men, and when he seeth iniquity, doth he not consider it?</p>
<p>12 A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass&rsquo;s colt.</p>
<p>13 But thou hast hardened thy heart, and hast spread thy hands to him.</p>
<p>14 If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and let not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:</p>
<p>15 Then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.</p>
<p>16 Thou shalt also forget misery, and remember it only as waters that are passed away.</p>
<p>17 And brightness like that of the noonday, shall arise to thee at evening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day star.</p>
<p>18 And thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee, and being buried thou shalt sleep secure.</p>
<p>19 Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall entreat thy face.</p>
<p>20 But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul.</p>
