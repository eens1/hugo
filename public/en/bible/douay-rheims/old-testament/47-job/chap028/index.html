<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Silver hath beginnings of its veins, and gold hath a place wherein it is melted.</p>
<p>2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone melted with heat is turned into brass.</p>
<p>3 He hath set a time for darkness, and the end of all things he considereth, the stone also that is in the dark and the shadow of death.</p>
<p>4 The flood divideth from the people that are on their journey, those whom the food of the needy man hath forgotten, and who cannot be come at.</p>
<p>5 The land, out of which bread grew in its place, hath been overturned with fire.</p>
<p>6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and the clods of it are gold.</p>
<p>7 The bird hath not known the path, neither hath the eye of the vulture beheld it.</p>
<p>8 The children of the merchants have not trodden it, neither hath the lioness passed by it.</p>
<p>9 He hath stretched forth his hand to the flint, he hath overturned mountains from the roots.</p>
<p>10 In the rocks he hath cut out rivers, and his eye hath seen every precious thing.</p>
<p>11 The depths also of rivers he hath searched, and hidden things he hath brought forth to light.</p>
<p>12 But where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p>13 Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of them that live in delights.</p>
<p>14 The depth saith: It is not in me: and the sea saith: It is not with me.</p>
<p>15 The finest gold shall not purchase it, neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it.</p>
<p>16 It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India, or with the most precious stone sardonyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p>17 Gold or crystal cannot equal it, neither shall any vessels of gold be changed for it.</p>
<p>18 High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of it: but wisdom is drawn out of secret places.</p>
<p>19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal to it, neither shall it be compared to the cleanest dyeing.</p>
<p>20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p>21 It is hid from the eyes of all living, and the fowls of the air know it not.</p>
<p>22 Destruction and death have said: With our ears we have heard the fame thereof.</p>
<p>23 God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p>24 For he beholdeth the ends of the world: and looketh on all things that are under heaven.</p>
<p>25 Who made a weight for the winds, and weighed the waters by measure.</p>
<p>26 When he gave a law for the rain, and a way for the sounding storms.</p>
<p>27 Then he saw it, and declared, and prepared, and searched it.</p>
<p>28 And he said to man: Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil, is understanding.</p>
