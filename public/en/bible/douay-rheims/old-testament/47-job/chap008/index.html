<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Baldad, the Suhite, answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
<p>3 Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?</p>
<p>4 Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:</p>
<p>5 Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:</p>
<p>6 If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake unto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:</p>
<p>7 In so much, that if thy former things were small thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.</p>
<p>8 For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:</p>
<p>9 (For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow)</p>
<p>10 And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.</p>
<p>11 Can the rush be green without moisture? or sedge bush grow without water?</p>
<p>12 When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.</p>
<p>13 Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:</p>
<p>14 His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>15 He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:</p>
<p>16 He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh; and at his rising, his blossom shall shoot forth.</p>
<p>17 His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones; and among the stones he shall abide.</p>
<p>18 If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.</p>
<p>19 For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.</p>
<p>20 God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evil doer:</p>
<p>21 Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p>22 They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.</p>
