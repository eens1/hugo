<h1>Chapter 40</h1>

<p>1 And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:</p>
<p>2 Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</p>
<p>3 Wilt thou make void my judgment: and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?</p>
<p>4 And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p>5 Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.</p>
<p>6 Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.</p>
<p>7 Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place,</p>
<p>8 Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.</p>
<p>9 Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.</p>
<p>10 Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.</p>
<p>11 His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p>12 He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.</p>
<p>13 His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.</p>
<p>14 He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.</p>
<p>15 To him the mountains bring forth grass: there all the beasts of the field shall play.</p>
<p>16 He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.</p>
<p>17 The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.</p>
<p>18 Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder: and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.</p>
<p>19 In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.</p>
<p>20 Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?</p>
<p>21 Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?</p>
<p>22 Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?</p>
<p>23 Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever?</p>
<p>24 Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?</p>
<p>25 Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?</p>
<p>26 Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?</p>
<p>27 Lay thy hand upon him: remember the battle, and speak no more.</p>
<p>28 Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.</p>
