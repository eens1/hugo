<h1>Chapter 19</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p>3 Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.</p>
<p>4 For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.</p>
<p>5 But you set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.</p>
<p>6 At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.</p>
<p>7 Behold I shall cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.</p>
<p>8 He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness.</p>
<p>9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p>10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.</p>
<p>11 His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.</p>
<p>12 His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.</p>
<p>13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.</p>
<p>14 My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me.</p>
<p>15 They that dwell in my house, and my maidservants have counted me as a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes.</p>
<p>16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth.</p>
<p>17 My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb.</p>
<p>18 Even fools despised me, and when I was gone from them, they spoke against me.</p>
<p>19 They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I loved most is turned against me.</p>
<p>20 The flesh being consumed, my bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.</p>
<p>21 Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.</p>
<p>22 Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?</p>
<p>23 Who will grant me that my words may be written? who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?</p>
<p>24 With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone?</p>
<p>25 For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.</p>
<p>26 And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my God.</p>
<p>27 Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.</p>
<p>28 Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?</p>
<p>29 Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is a judgment.</p>
