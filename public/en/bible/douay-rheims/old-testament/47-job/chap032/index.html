<h1>Chapter 32</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.</p>
<p>2 And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.</p>
<p>3 And he was angry with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</p>
<p>4 So Eliu waited while Job was speaking because they were his elders that were speaking.</p>
<p>5 But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.</p>
<p>6 Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.</p>
<p>7 For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</p>
<p>8 But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</p>
<p>9 They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.</p>
<p>10 Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.</p>
<p>11 For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</p>
<p>12 And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.</p>
<p>13 Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.</p>
<p>14 He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.</p>
<p>15 They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.</p>
<p>16 Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:</p>
<p>17 I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.</p>
<p>18 For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.</p>
<p>19 Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.</p>
<p>20 I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.</p>
<p>21 I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.</p>
<p>22 For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</p>
