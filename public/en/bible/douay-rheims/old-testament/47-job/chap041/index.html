<h1>Chapter 41</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?</p>
<p>2 Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.</p>
<p>3 I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.</p>
<p>4 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</p>
<p>5 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</p>
<p>6 His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.</p>
<p>7 One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:</p>
<p>8 They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.</p>
<p>9 His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p>10 Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.</p>
<p>11 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.</p>
<p>12 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.</p>
<p>13 In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.</p>
<p>14 The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.</p>
<p>15 His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith&rsquo;s anvil.</p>
<p>16 When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves.</p>
<p>17 When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.</p>
<p>18 For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p>19 The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.</p>
<p>20 As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.</p>
<p>21 The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire.</p>
<p>22 He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.</p>
<p>23 A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.</p>
<p>24 There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one.</p>
<p>25 He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride.</p>
