<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind is hurried away to different things.</p>
<p>3 The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me.</p>
<p>4 This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon the earth,</p>
<p>5 That the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.</p>
<p>6 If his pride mount up even to heaven, and his head touch the clouds:</p>
<p>7 In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and they that had seen him, shall say: Where is he?</p>
<p>8 As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he shall pass as a vision of the night:</p>
<p>9 The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p>10 His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands shall render to him his sorrow.</p>
<p>11 His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust.</p>
<p>12 For when evil shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.</p>
<p>13 He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in his throat.</p>
<p>14 His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps within him,</p>
<p>15 The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit up, and God shall draw them out of his belly.</p>
<p>16 He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper&rsquo;s tongue shall kill him.</p>
<p>17 Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of honey and of butter.</p>
<p>18 He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall not be consumed: according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he suffer.</p>
<p>19 Because he broke in and stripped the poor: he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.</p>
<p>20 And yet his belly was not filled: and when he hath the things he coveted, he shall not be able to possess them.</p>
<p>21 There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing shall continue of his goods:</p>
<p>22 When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall burn, and every sorrow shall fall upon him.</p>
<p>23 May his belly be filled, that God may send forth the wrath of his indignation upon him, and rain down his war upon him.</p>
<p>24 He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a bow of brass.</p>
<p>25 The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its scabbard, and glittereth in his bitterness: the terrible ones shall go and come upon him.</p>
<p>26 All darkness is hid in his secret places: a fire that is not kindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in his tabernacle.</p>
<p>27 The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p>28 The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be pulled down in the day of God&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his doings from the Lord.</p>
