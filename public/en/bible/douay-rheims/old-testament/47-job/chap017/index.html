<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My spirit shall be wasted, my days shall be shortened and only the grave remaineth for me.</p>
<p>2 I have not sinned, and my eye abideth in bitterness.</p>
<p>3 Deliver me, O Lord, and set me beside thee, and let any man&rsquo;s hand fight against me.</p>
<p>4 Thou hast set their heart far from understanding, therefore they shall not be exalted.</p>
<p>5 He promiseth a prey to his companions, and the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p>6 He hath made me as it were a byword of the people, and I am an example before them.</p>
<p>7 My eye is dim through indignation, and my limbs are brought as it were to nothing.</p>
<p>8 The just shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall be raised up against the hypocrite.</p>
<p>9 And the just man shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>10 Wherefore be you all converted, and come, and I shall not find among you any wise man.</p>
<p>11 My days have passed away, my thoughts are dissipated, tormenting my heart.</p>
<p>12 They have turned night into day, and after darkness I hope for light again.</p>
<p>13 If I wait hell is my house, and I have made my bed in darkness.</p>
<p>14 I have said to rottenness: Thou art my father; to worms, my mother and my sister.</p>
<p>15 Where is now then my expectation, and who considereth my patience?</p>
<p>16 All that I have shall go down into the deepest pit: thinkest thou that there at least I shall have rest?</p>
