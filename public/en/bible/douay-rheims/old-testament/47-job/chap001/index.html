<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.</p>
<p>2 And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p>3 And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</p>
<p>4 And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.</p>
<p>5 And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.</p>
<p>6 Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</p>
<p>7 And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</p>
<p>8 And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</p>
<p>9 And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?</p>
<p>10 Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?</p>
<p>11 But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.</p>
<p>12 Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>13 Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,</p>
<p>14 There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</p>
<p>15 And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>16 And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>17 And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>18 He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</p>
<p>19 A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>20 Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p>
<p>21 And said: Naked came I out of my mother&rsquo;s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>22 In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</p>
