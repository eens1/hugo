<h1>Chapter 30</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock:</p>
<p>2 The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself.</p>
<p>3 Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery.</p>
<p>4 And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food.</p>
<p>5 Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when they had found any of them, they ran to them with a cry.</p>
<p>6 They dwelt in the desert places of torrents, and in caves of earth, or upon the gravel.</p>
<p>7 They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and counted it delightful to be under the briers.</p>
<p>8 The children of foolish and base men, and not appearing at all upon the earth.</p>
<p>9 Now I am turned into their song, and am become their byword.</p>
<p>10 They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid to spit in my face.</p>
<p>11 For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and hath put a bridle into my mouth.</p>
<p>12 At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves.</p>
<p>13 They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to help.</p>
<p>14 They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken, and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries.</p>
<p>15 I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud.</p>
<p>16 And now my soul fadeth within myself, and the days of affliction possess me.</p>
<p>17 In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they that feed upon me, do not sleep.</p>
<p>18 With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they have girded me about, as with the collar of my coat.</p>
<p>19 I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and ashes.</p>
<p>20 I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and thou dost not regard me.</p>
<p>21 Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me.</p>
<p>22 Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me.</p>
<p>23 I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house is appointed for every one that liveth.</p>
<p>24 But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt save.</p>
<p>25 I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my soul had compassion on the poor.</p>
<p>26 I expected good things, and evils are come upon me: I waited for light, and darkness broke out.</p>
<p>27 My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of affliction have prevented me.</p>
<p>28 I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried in the crowd.</p>
<p>29 I was the brother of dragons, and companion of ostriches.</p>
<p>30 My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up with heat.</p>
<p>31 My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.</p>
