<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.</p>
<p>2 As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;</p>
<p>3 So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.</p>
<p>4 If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I rise? and again, I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness.</p>
<p>5 My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust; my skin is withered and drawn together.</p>
<p>6 My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver, and are consumed without any hope.</p>
<p>7 Remember that my life is but wind, and my eye shall not return to see good things.</p>
<p>8 Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon me, and I shall be no more.</p>
<p>9 As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shall go down to hell shall not come up.</p>
<p>10 Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more</p>
<p>11 Wherefore, I will not spare my mouth, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p>12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a prison?</p>
<p>13 If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved, speaking with myself on my couch:</p>
<p>14 Thou wilt frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions.</p>
<p>15 So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.</p>
<p>16 I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare me, for my days are nothing.</p>
<p>17 What is a man, that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou set thy heart upon him?</p>
<p>18 Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him suddenly.</p>
<p>19 How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p>20 I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men? why hast thou set me opposite to thee. and am I become burdensome to myself?</p>
<p>21 Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.</p>
