<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the tribes, twelve rods, and write the name of every man upon his rod.</p>
<p>3 And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi, and one rod shall contain all their families:</p>
<p>4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to thee.</p>
<p>5 Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, wherewith they murmur against you.</p>
<p>6 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe: and there were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron.</p>
<p>7 And when Moses had Laid them up before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony:</p>
<p>8 He returned on the following day, and found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded: and that the buds swelling it hid bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves, were formed into almonds.</p>
<p>9 Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel: and they saw, and every one received their rods.</p>
<p>10 And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel, and that their complaints may cease from me lest they die.</p>
<p>11 And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.</p>
<p>12 And the children of Israel said to Moses: Behold we are consumed, we all perish.</p>
<p>13 Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth. Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed?</p>
