<p>1 And it came to pass in the day that Moses had finished the tabernacle, and set it up, and had anointed and sanctified it with all its vessels, the altar likewise and all the vessels thereof,</p>
<p>2 The princes of Israel and the heads of the families, in every tribe, who were the rulers of them who had been numbered, offered</p>
<p>3 Their gifts before the Lord, six wagons covered, and twelve oxen. Two princes offered one wagon, and each one an ox, and they offered them before the tabernacle.</p>
<p>4 And the Lord said to Moses:</p>
<p>5 Receive them from them to serve in the ministry of the tabernacle, and thou shalt deliver them to the Levites according to the order of their ministry.</p>

<p>8 The other four wagons, and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their offices and service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>
<p>9 But to the sons of Caath he gave no wagons or oxen: because they serve in the sanctuary and carry their burdens upon their own shoulders.</p>
<p>10 And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar on the day when it was anointed, their oblation before the altar.</p>
