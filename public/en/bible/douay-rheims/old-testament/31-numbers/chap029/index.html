<p>28 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>29 The sixth day you shall offer eight calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>30 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:</p>
<p>31 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
