<p>9 And Jabes was more honourable than any of his brethren, and his mother called his name Jabes, saying: Because I bore him with sorrow.</p>
<p>10 And Jabes called upon the God of Israel, saying: If blessing thou wilt bless me, and wilt enlarge my borders, and thy hand be with me, and thou save me from being oppressed by evil. And God granted him the things he prayed for.</p>

<p>22 And he that made the sun to stand, and the men of Lying, and Secure, and Burning, who were princes in Moab, and who returned into Lahem. Now these are things of old.</p>
<p>23 These are the potters, and they dwelt in Plantations, and Hedges, with the king for his works, and they abode there.</p>
<p>24 The sons of Simeon: Namuel and Jamin, Jarib, Zara, Saul:</p>

<p>26 The sons of Masma: Hamuel his son, Zachur his son, Semei his son.</p>

<p>32 Their towns also were Etam, and Aen, Remmon, and Thochen, and Asan, five cities.</p>
<p>33 And all their villages round about these cities as far as Baal. This was their habitation, and the distribution of their dwellings.</p>
<p>34 And Mosabab and Jemlech, and Josaphat, the son of Amasias,</p>
<p>35 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josabia the son of Saraia, the son of Asiel,</p>

<p>39 And they went forth to enter into Gador as far as to the east side of the valley, to seek pastures for their flocks.</p>
<p>40 And they found fat pastures, and very good, and a country spacious, and quiet, and fruitful, in which some of the race of Cham had dwelt before.</p>
<p>41 And these whose names are written above, came in the days of Ezechias king of Juda: and they beat down their tents, and slew the inhabitants that were found there, and utterly destroyed them unto this day: and they dwelt in their place, because they found there fat pastures.</p>
<p>42 Some also of the children of Simeon, five hundred men, went into mount Seir, having for their captains Phaltias and Naaria and Raphaia and Oziel the sons of Jesi:</p>
<p>43 And they slew the remnant of the Amalecites, who had been able to escape, and they dwelt there in their stead unto this day.</p>
