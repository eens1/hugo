<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.</p>
<p>2 And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee.</p>
<p>3 Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</p>
<p>4 Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.</p>
<p>5 For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,</p>
<p>6 Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</p>
<p>7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.</p>
<p>8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</p>
<p>9 And I have given a place my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,</p>
<p>10 Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.</p>
<p>11 And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p>12 He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</p>
<p>13 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</p>
<p>14 But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</p>
<p>15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>
<p>16 And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?</p>
<p>17 But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</p>
<p>18 What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?</p>
<p>19 O Lord, for thy servant&rsquo;s sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.</p>
<p>20 O Lord there is none like thee: and here is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</p>
<p>21 For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?</p>
<p>22 And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.</p>
<p>23 Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p>24 And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.</p>
<p>25 For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.</p>
<p>26 And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.</p>
<p>27 And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
