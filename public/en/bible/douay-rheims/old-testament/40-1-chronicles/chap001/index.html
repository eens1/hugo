<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Adam, Seth, Enos,</p>
<p>2 Cainan, Malaleel, Jared,</p>
<p>3 Henoc, Mathusale, Lamech,</p>
<p>4 Noe, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.</p>
<p>5 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, Thubal, Mosoch, Thiras.</p>
<p>6 And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez, and Riphath, and Thogorma.</p>
<p>7 And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cethim and Dodanim.</p>
<p>8 The sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesrai, and Phut, and Chanaan.</p>
<p>9 And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila, Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabathaca. And the sons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.</p>
<p>10 Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty upon earth.</p>
<p>11 But Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, and Nephtuim,</p>
<p>12 Phetrusim also, and Casluim: from whom came the Philistines, and Caphtorim.</p>
<p>13 And Chanaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and the Hethite,</p>
<p>14 And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite,</p>
<p>15 And the Hevite, and the Aracite, and the Sinite,</p>
<p>16 And the Aradian, and the Samarite, and the Hamathite.</p>
<p>17 The sons of Sem: Elam and Asur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Hus, and Hul, and Gether, and Mosoch.</p>
<p>18 And Arphaxad begot Sale, and Sale begot Heber.</p>
<p>19 And to Heber were born two sons, the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided; and the name of his brother was Jectan.</p>
<p>20 And Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, and Jare,</p>
<p>21 And Adoram, and Usal, and Decla,</p>
<p>22 And Hebal, and Abimael, and Saba,</p>
<p>23 And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All these are the sons of Jectan.</p>
<p>24 Sem, Arphaxad, Sale,</p>
<p>25 Heber, Phaleg, Ragau,</p>
<p>26 Serug, Nachor, Thare,</p>
<p>27 Abram, this is Abraham.</p>
<p>28 And the sons of Abraham, Isaac and Ismahel.</p>
<p>29 And these are the generations of them. The firstborn of Ismahel, Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam,</p>
<p>30 And Masma, and Duma, Massa, Hadad, and Thema,</p>
<p>31 Jetur, Naphis, Cedma: these are the sons of Ismahel.</p>
<p>32 And the sons of Cetura, Abraham&rsquo;s concubine, whom she bore: Zamran, Jecsan, Madan, Madian, Jesboc, and Sue. And the sons of Jecsan, Saba, and Dadan. And the sons of Dadan: Assurim, and Latussim, and Laomin.</p>
<p>33 And the sons of Madian: Epha, and Epher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa. All these are the sons of Cetura.</p>
<p>34 And Abraham begot Isaac: and his sons were Esau and Israel.</p>
<p>35 The sons of Esau: Eliphaz, Rahuel, Jehus, Ihelom, and Core.</p>
<p>36 The sons of Eliphaz: Theman, Omar, Sephi, Gathan, Cenez, and by Thamna, Amalec.</p>
<p>37 The sons of Rahuel: Nahath, Zara, Samma, Meza.</p>
<p>38 The sons of Seir: Lotan, Sobal, Sebeon, Ana, Dison, Eser, Disan.</p>
<p>39 The sons of Lotan: Hori, Homam. And the sister of Lotan was Thamna.</p>
<p>40 The sons of Sobal: Alian, and Manahath, and Ebal, Sephi, and Onam. The sons of Sebeon: Aia, and Ana. The son of Ana: Dison.</p>
<p>41 The sons of Dison: Hamram, and Eseban, and Jethran, and Charan.</p>
<p>42 The sons of Eser: Balaan, and Zavan, and Jacan. The sons of Disan: Hus and Aran.</p>
<p>43 Now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there was a king over the children of Israel: Bale the son of Beor: and the name of his city was Denaba.</p>
<p>44 And Bale died, and Jobab the son of Zare of Bosra, reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>45 And when Jobab also was dead, Husam of the land of the Themanites reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>46 And Husam also died, and Adad the son of Badad reigned in his stead, and he defeated the Madianites in the land of Moab: the name of his city was Avith.</p>
<p>47 And when Adad also was dead, Semla of Masreca reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>48 Semla also died, and Saul of Rohoboth, which is near the river, reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>49 And when Saul was dead, Balanan the son of Achobor reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>50 He also died, and Adad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Phau, and his wife was called Meetabel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezaab.</p>
<p>51 And after the death of Adad, there began to be dukes in Edom instead of kings: duke Thamna, duke Alva, duke Jetheth,</p>
<p>52 Duke Oolibama, duke Ela, duke Phinon,</p>
<p>53 Duke Cenez, duke Theman, duke Mabsar,</p>
<p>54 Duke Magdiel, duke Hiram. These are the dukes of Edom.</p>
