<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.</p>
<p>2 And she conceived, and bore a son: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.</p>
<p>3 And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river&rsquo;s brink,</p>
<p>4 His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.</p>
<p>5 And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river&rsquo;s brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</p>
<p>6 She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>7 And the child&rsquo;s sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?</p>
<p>8 She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</p>
<p>9 And Pharao&rsquo;s daughter said to her: Take this child, and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>10 And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.</p>
<p>11 In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.</p>
<p>12 And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</p>
<p>13 And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</p>
<p>14 But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?</p>
<p>15 And Pharao heard of this word, and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.</p>
<p>16 And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father&rsquo;s flocks.</p>
<p>17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</p>
<p>18 And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?</p>
<p>19 They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</p>
<p>20 But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.</p>
<p>21 And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</p>
<p>22 And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper, hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.</p>
<p>23 Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.</p>
<p>24 And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>25 And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</p>
