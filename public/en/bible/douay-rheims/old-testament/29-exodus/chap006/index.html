<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord said to Moses: Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao: for by a mighty hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his land.</p>
<p>2 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord</p>
<p>3 That appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty: and my name ADONAI I did not shew them.</p>
<p>4 And I made a covenant with them, to give them the land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers.</p>
<p>5 I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them: and I have remembered my covenant.</p>
<p>6 Therefore say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord who will bring you out from the work-prison of the Egyptians, and will deliver you from bondage: and redeem you with a high arm, and great judgments.</p>
<p>7 And I will take you to myself for my people, I will be your God: and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the work-prison of the Egyptians:</p>
<p>8 And brought you into the land, concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and I will give it you to possess: I am the Lord.</p>
<p>9 And Moses told all this to the children of Israel: but they did not hearken to him, for anguish of spirit, and most painful work.</p>
<p>10 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>11 Go in, and speak to Pharao king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>
<p>12 Moses answered before the Lord: Behold the children of Israel do not hearken to me: and how will Pharao hear me, especially as I am of uncircumcised lips?</p>
<p>13 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and he gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharao the king of Egypt, that they should bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>14 These are the heads of their houses by their families. The sons of Ruben the firstborn of Israel: Henoch and Phallu, Hesron and Charmi.</p>
<p>15 These are the kindreds of Ruben. The sons of Simeon, Jamuel and Jamin, and Ahod, and Jachin, and Soar, and Saul the son of a Chanaanitess: these are the families of Simeon.</p>
<p>16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindreds: Gerson, and Caath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p>17 The sons of Gerson: Lobni and Semei, by their kindreds.</p>
<p>18 The sons of Caath: Amram, and Isaar, and Hebron and Oziel. And the years of Caath&rsquo;s life, were a hundred and thirty-three.</p>
<p>19 The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi. These are the kindreds of Levi by their families.</p>
<p>20 And Amram took to wife Jochabed his aunt by the father&rsquo;s side: and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of Amram&rsquo;s life, were a hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p>21 The sons also of Isaar: Core, and Nepheg, and Zechri.</p>
<p>22 The sons also of Oziel: Mizael, and Elizaphan, and Sethri.</p>
<p>23 And Aaron took to wife Elizabeth the daughter of Aminadab, sister of Nahason, who bore him Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p>24 The sons also of Core: Aser, and Elcana, and Abiasaph. These are the kindreds of the Corites.</p>
<p>25 But Eleazar the son of Aaron took a wife of the daughters of Phutiel: and she bore him Phinees. These are the heads of the Levitical families by their kindreds.</p>
<p>26 These are Aaron and Moses, whom the Lord commanded to bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies.</p>
<p>27 These are they that speak to Pharao, king of Egypt, in order to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>28 In the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>29 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord; speak thou to Pharao, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee.</p>
<p>30 And Moses said before the Lord: Lo I am of uncircumcised lips, how will Pharao hear me?</p>
