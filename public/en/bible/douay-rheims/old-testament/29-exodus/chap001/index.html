<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in every man with his household:</p>
<p>2 Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,</p>
<p>3 Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,</p>
<p>4 Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.</p>
<p>5 And all the souls that came out of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</p>
<p>6 After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,</p>
<p>7 The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</p>
<p>8 In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</p>
<p>9 And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.</p>
<p>10 Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</p>
<p>11 Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.</p>
<p>12 But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.</p>
<p>13 And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:</p>
<p>14 And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.</p>
<p>15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</p>
<p>16 Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.</p>
<p>17 But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.</p>
<p>18 And the king called for them and said: What is it that you meant to do, that you would save the men children?</p>
<p>19 They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</p>
<p>20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</p>
<p>21 And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.</p>
<p>22 Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.</p>
