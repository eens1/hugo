<h1>Chapter 24</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And he said to Moses: Come up to the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel, and you shall adore afar off.</p>
<p>2 And Moses alone shall come up to the Lord, but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people come up with him.</p>
<p>3 So Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice: We will do all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken.</p>
<p>4 And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord: and rising in the morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mount, and twelve titles according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, and they offered holocausts, and sacrificed pacific victims of calves to the Lord.</p>
<p>6 Then Moses took half of the blood, and put it into bowls; and the rest he poured upon the altar.</p>
<p>7 And taking the book of the covenant, he read it in the hearing of the people: and they said: All things that the Lord hath spoken, we will do, we will be obedient.</p>
<p>8 And he took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people, and he said: This is the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.</p>
<p>9 Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel went up:</p>
<p>10 And they saw the God of Israel: and under his feet as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as the heaven, when clear.</p>
<p>11 Neither did he lay his hand upon those of the children of Israel, that retired afar off, and they saw God, and they did eat and drink.</p>
<p>12 And the Lord said to Moses: Come up to me into the mount, and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and the law, and the commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.</p>
<p>13 Moses rose up, and his minister Josue: and Moses going up into the mount of God,</p>
<p>14 Said to the ancients: Wait ye here till we return to you. You have Aaron and Hur with you: if any question shall arise, you shall refer it to them.</p>
<p>15 And when Moses was gone up, a cloud covered the mount.</p>
<p>16 And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai, covering it with a cloud six days: and the seventh day he called him out of the midst of the cloud.</p>
<p>17 And the sight of the glory of the Lord, was like a burning fire upon the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>18 And Moses entering into the midst of the cloud, went up into the mountain: And he was there forty days and forty nights.</p>
