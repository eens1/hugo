<h1>Chapter 30</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Thou shalt make also an altar to burn incense, of setim wood.</p>
<p>2 It shall be a cubit in length, and another in breadth, that is, four square, and two in height. Horns shall go out of the same.</p>
<p>3 And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold, as well the grate thereof, as the walls round about, and the horns. And thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about,</p>
<p>4 And two golden rings under the crown on either side, that the bars may be put into them, and the altar be carried.</p>
<p>5 And thou shalt make the bars also of setim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold.</p>
<p>6 And thou shalt set the altar over against the veil, that hangeth before the ark of the testimony before the propitiatory wherewith the testimony is covered, where I will speak to thee.</p>
<p>7 And Aaron shall burn sweet smelling incense upon it in the morning. When he shall dress the lamps, he shall burn it:</p>
<p>8 And when he shall place them in the evening, he shall burn an everlasting incense before the Lord throughout your generations.</p>
<p>9 You shall not offer upon it incense of another composition, nor oblation, and victim, neither shall you offer libations.</p>
<p>10 And Aaron shall pray upon the horns thereof once a year, with the blood of that which was offered for sin; and shall make atonement upon it in your generations. It shall be most holy to the Lord.</p>
<p>11 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>12 When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, every one of them shall give a price for their souls to the Lord, and there shall be no scourge among them, when they shall be reckoned.</p>
<p>13 And this shall every one give that passeth at the naming, half a sicle according to the standard of the temple. A sicle hath twenty obols. Half a sicle shall be offered to the Lord.</p>
<p>14 He that is counted in the number from twenty years and upwards, shall give the price.</p>
<p>15 The rich man shall not add to half a sicle, and the poor man shall diminish nothing.</p>
<p>16 And the money received, which was contributed by the children of Israel, thou shalt deliver unto the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord, and he may be merciful to their souls.</p>
<p>17 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>18 Thou shalt make also a brazen laver with its foot to wash in: and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar. And water being put into it:</p>
<p>19 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in it:</p>
<p>20 When they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony, and when they are to come to the altar, to offer on it incense to the Lord,</p>
<p>21 Lest perhaps they die. It shall be an everlasting law to him, and to his seed by successions.</p>
<p>22 And the Lord spoke to Moses,</p>
<p>23 Saying: Take spices, of principal and chosen myrrh five hundred sicles, and of cinnamon half so much; that is, two hundred and fifty sicles, of calamus in like manner two hundred and fifty,</p>
<p>24 And of cassia five hundred sicles by the weight of the sanctuary, of oil of olives the measure hin:</p>
<p>25 And thou shalt make the holy oil of unction, an ointment compounded after the art of the perfumer,</p>
<p>26 And therewith thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the testimony, and the ark of the testament,</p>
<p>27 And the table with the vessels thereof, the candlestick and furniture thereof, the altars of incense,</p>
<p>28 And of holocaust, and all the furniture that belongeth to the service of them.</p>
<p>29 And thou shalt sanctify all, and they shall be most holy: he that shall touch them shall be sanctified.</p>
<p>30 Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do the office of priesthood unto me.</p>
<p>31 And thou shalt say to the children of Israel: This oil of unction shall be holy unto me throughout your generations.</p>
<p>32 The flesh of man shall not be anointed therewith, and you shall make none other of the same composition, because it is sanctified, and shall be holy unto you.</p>
<p>33 What man soever shall compound such, and shall give thereof to a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p>34 And the Lord said to Moses: Take unto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, galbanum of sweet savour, and the clearest frankincense, all shall be of equal weight.</p>
<p>35 And thou shalt make incense compounded by the work of the perfumer, well tempered together, and pure, and most worthy of sanctification.</p>
<p>36 And when thou hast beaten all into very small powder, thou shalt set of it before the tabernacle of the testimony, in the place where I will appear to thee. Most holy shall this incense be unto you.</p>
<p>37 You shall not make such a composition for your own uses, because it is holy to the Lord.</p>
<p>38 What man soever shall make the like, to enjoy the smell thereof, he shall perish out of his people.</p>
