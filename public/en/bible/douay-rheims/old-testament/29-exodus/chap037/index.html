<h1>Chapter 37</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 And Beseleel made also, the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.</p>
<p>2 And he made to it a crown of gold round about,</p>
<p>3 Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.</p>
<p>4 And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,</p>
<p>5 And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.</p>
<p>6 He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.</p>
<p>7 Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:</p>
<p>8 One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,</p>
<p>9 Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</p>
<p>10 He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.</p>
<p>11 And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about,</p>
<p>12 And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.</p>
<p>13 And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,</p>
<p>14 Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.</p>
<p>15 The bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
<p>16 And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.</p>
<p>17 He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. from the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:</p>
<p>18 Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.</p>
<p>19 Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies: and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches, that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.</p>
<p>20 And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:</p>
<p>21 And bowls under two branches in three places, which together made six branches going out from one shaft.</p>
<p>22 So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.</p>
<p>23 He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.</p>
<p>24 The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.</p>
<p>25 He made also the alter of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.</p>
<p>26 And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate, and the sides, and the horns.</p>
<p>27 And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.</p>
<p>28 And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.</p>
<p>29 He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.</p>
