<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Juda,</p>
<p>3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge in all manner of work,</p>
<p>4 To devise whatsoever may be artificially made of gold, and silver, and brass,</p>
<p>5 Of marble, and precious stones, and variety of wood.</p>
<p>6 And I have given him for his companion Ooliab, the son of Achisamech, of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the heart of every skilful man, that they may make all things which I have commanded thee,</p>
<p>7 The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory, that is over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,</p>
<p>8 And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure candlestick with the vessels thereof, and the altars of incense,</p>
<p>9 And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver with its foot,</p>
<p>10 The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest, and for his sons, that they may execute their office, about the sacred things:</p>
<p>11 The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the sanctuary, all things which I have commanded thee, shall they make.</p>
<p>12 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>13 Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: See that you keep my sabbath; because it is a sign between me and you in your generations that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you.</p>
<p>14 keep you my sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that shall profane it, shall be put to death: he that shall do any work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people.</p>
<p>15 Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord. Every one that shall do any work on this day, shall die.</p>
<p>16 Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting covenant</p>
<p>17 Between me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.</p>
<p>18 And the Lord, when he had ended these words in Mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written with the finger of God.</p>
