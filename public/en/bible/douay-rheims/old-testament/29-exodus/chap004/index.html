<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Moses answered, and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.</p>
<p>2 Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.</p>
<p>3 And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moses fled from it.</p>
<p>4 And the Lord said: Put out thy hand, and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.</p>
<p>5 That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.</p>
<p>6 And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.</p>
<p>7 And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.</p>
<p>8 If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.</p>
<p>9 But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river, shall be turned into blood.</p>
<p>10 Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before; and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.</p>
<p>11 The Lord said to him: Who made man&rsquo;s mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?</p>
<p>12 Go therefore, and I will be in thy mouth; and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.</p>
<p>13 But he said: I beseech thee, Lord, send whom thou wilt send.</p>
<p>14 The Lord being angry at Moses, said: Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee, shall be glad at heart.</p>
<p>15 Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his month, and will shew you what you must do.</p>
<p>16 He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.</p>
<p>17 And take this rod in thy hand. wherewith thou shalt do the signs.</p>
<p>18 Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him; I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.</p>
<p>19 And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt; for they are all dead that sought thy life.</p>
<p>20 Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass; and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.</p>
<p>21 And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.</p>
<p>22 And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.</p>
<p>23 I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.</p>
<p>24 And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.</p>
<p>25 Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and touched his feet, and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.</p>
<p>26 And he let him go after she had said: A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.</p>
<p>27 And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.</p>
<p>28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.</p>
<p>29 And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>30 And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people.</p>
<p>31 And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.</p>
