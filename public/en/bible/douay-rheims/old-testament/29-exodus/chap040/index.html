<h1>Chapter 40</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
<p>3 And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the veil before it:</p>
<p>4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite. The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</p>
<p>5 And the altar of gold, whereon the incense is burnt before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,</p>
<p>6 And before it the altar of holocaust.</p>
<p>7 The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.</p>
<p>8 And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.</p>
<p>9 And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:</p>
<p>10 The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:</p>
<p>11 The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.</p>
<p>12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.</p>
<p>14 And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.</p>
<p>15 So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</p>
<p>16 And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</p>
<p>17 And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
<p>18 And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.</p>
<p>19 And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p>20 And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, without the veil,</p>
<p>21 Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>22 He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony, over against the table on the south side,</p>
<p>23 Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.</p>
<p>24 He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony, over against the veil,</p>
<p>25 And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>26 And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
<p>27 And the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
<p>28 And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</p>
<p>29 And Moses and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and feet,</p>
<p>30 When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>31 He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,</p>
<p>32 The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.</p>
<p>33 Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.</p>
<p>34 If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:</p>
<p>35 If it hung over, they remained in the same place.</p>
<p>36 For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</p>
