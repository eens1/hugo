<h1>Chapter 76</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.</p>
<p>2 I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.</p>
<p>3 In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:</p>
<p>4 I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.</p>
<p>5 My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.</p>
<p>6 I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.</p>
<p>7 And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.</p>
<p>8 Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?</p>
<p>9 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?</p>
<p>10 Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?</p>
<p>11 And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.</p>
<p>12 I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.</p>
<p>13 And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.</p>
<p>14 Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?</p>
<p>15 Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations:</p>
<p>16 With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.</p>
<p>17 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.</p>
<p>18 Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:</p>
<p>19 The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.</p>
<p>20 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.</p>
<p>21 Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
