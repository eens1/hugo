<h1>Chapter 82</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.</p>
<p>2 O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God.</p>
<p>3 For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
<p>4 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.</p>
<p>5 They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.</p>
<p>6 For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a covenant together against thee,</p>
<p>7 The tabernacle of the Edomites, and the Ishmahelites: Moab, and the Agarens,</p>
<p>8 Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.</p>
<p>9 Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.</p>
<p>10 Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson.</p>
<p>11 Who perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth.</p>
<p>12 Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana. All their princes,</p>
<p>13 Who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.</p>
<p>14 O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind.</p>
<p>15 As fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains:</p>
<p>16 So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.</p>
<p>17 Fill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.</p>
<p>18 Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: and let them be confounded and perish.</p>
<p>19 And let them know that the Lord is thy name: thou alone art the most High over all the earth.</p>
