<h1>Chapter 37</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.</p>
<p>2 Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.</p>
<p>3 For thy arrows are fastened in me: and thy hand hath been strong upon me.</p>
<p>4 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.</p>
<p>5 For my iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.</p>
<p>6 My sores are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness.</p>
<p>7 I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: I walked sorrowful all the day long.</p>
<p>8 For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh.</p>
<p>9 I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning of my heart.</p>
<p>10 Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.</p>
<p>11 My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.</p>
<p>12 My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were near me stood afar off:</p>
<p>13 And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.</p>
<p>14 But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.</p>
<p>15 And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.</p>
<p>16 For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.</p>
<p>17 For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.</p>
<p>18 For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before me.</p>
<p>19 For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think for my sin.</p>
<p>20 But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
<p>21 They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.</p>
<p>22 For sake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me.</p>
<p>23 Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.</p>
