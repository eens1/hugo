<h1>Chapter 43</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding.</p>
<p>2 We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to us, The work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.</p>
<p>3 Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou didst afflict the people and cast them out.</p>
<p>4 For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased with them.</p>
<p>5 Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving of Jacob.</p>
<p>6 Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.</p>
<p>7 For I will not trust in my bow: neither shall my sword save me.</p>
<p>8 But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put them to shame that hate us.</p>
<p>9 In God shall we glory all the day long: and in thy name we will give praise for ever.</p>
<p>10 But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: and thou , O God, wilt not go out with our armies.</p>
<p>11 Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies: and they that hated us plundered for themselves.</p>
<p>12 Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: thou hast scattered us among the nations.</p>
<p>13 Thou hast sold thy people for no price: and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.</p>
<p>14 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>15 Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: a shaking of the head among the people.</p>
<p>16 All the day long my shame is before me: and the confusion of my face hath covered me,</p>
<p>17 At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: at the face of the enemy and persecutor.</p>
<p>18 All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee: and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.</p>
<p>19 And our heart hath not turned back: neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.</p>
<p>20 For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the shadow of death hath covered us.</p>
<p>21 If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god:</p>
<p>22 Shall not God search out these things: for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p>23 Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end.</p>
<p>24 Why turnest thou thy face away? and forgettest our want and our trouble?</p>
<p>25 For our soul is humbled down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to the earth.</p>
<p>26 Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name&rsquo;s sake.</p>
