<h1>Chapter 95</h1>

<p>1 A canticle for David himself, when the house was built after the captivity. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: sing to the Lord, all the earth.</p>
<p>2 Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name: shew forth his salvation from day to day.</p>
<p>3 Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.</p>
<p>4 For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p>5 For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.</p>
<p>6 Praise and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>7 Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to the Lord glory and honour:</p>
<p>8 Bring to the Lord glory unto his name. Bring up sacrifices, and come into his courts:</p>
<p>9 Adore ye the Lord in his holy court. Let all the earth be moved at his presence.</p>
<p>10 Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned. For he hath corrected the world, which shall not be moved: he will judge the people with justice.</p>
<p>11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof:</p>
<p>12 The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then shall all the trees of the woods rejoice</p>
<p>13 before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with his truth.</p>
