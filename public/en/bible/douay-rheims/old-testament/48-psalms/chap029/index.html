<h1>Chapter 29</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm of a canticle, at the dedication of David&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>2 I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me.</p>
<p>3 O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>
<p>4 Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.</p>
<p>5 Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory of his holiness.</p>
<p>6 For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.</p>
<p>7 And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.</p>
<p>8 O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.</p>
<p>9 To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my God.</p>
<p>10 What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption? Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth?</p>
<p>11 The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my helper.</p>
<p>12 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness:</p>
<p>13 To the end that my glory may sing to thee, and I may not regret: O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.</p>
