<h1>Chapter 96</h1>

<p>1 For the same David, when his land was restored again to him. The Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.</p>
<p>2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: justice and judgment are the establishment of his throne.</p>
<p>3 A fire shall go before him, and shall burn his enemies round about.</p>
<p>4 His lightnings have shone forth to the world: the earth saw and trembled.</p>
<p>5 The mountains melted like wax, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.</p>
<p>6 The heavens declared his justice: and all people saw his glory.</p>
<p>7 Let them be all confounded that adore graven things, and that glory in their idols. Adore him, all you his angels:</p>
<p>8 Sion heard, and was glad. And the daughters of Juda rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Lord.</p>
<p>9 For thou art the most high Lord over all the earth: thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.</p>
<p>10 You that love the Lord, hate evil: the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints, he will deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.</p>
<p>11 Light is risen to the just, and joy to the right of heart.</p>
<p>12 Rejoice, ye just, in the Lord: and give praise to the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
