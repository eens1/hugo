<h1>Chapter 89</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.</p>
<p>2 Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.</p>
<p>3 Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.</p>
<p>4 For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night,</p>
<p>5 Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.</p>
<p>6 In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.</p>
<p>7 For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation.</p>
<p>8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p>9 For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered as a spider:</p>
<p>10 The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected.</p>
<p>11 Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear</p>
<p>12 Can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom.</p>
<p>13 Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants.</p>
<p>14 We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.</p>
<p>15 We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils.</p>
<p>16 Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children.</p>
<p>17 And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.</p>
