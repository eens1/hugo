<h1>Chapter 35</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for the servant of God, David himself.</p>
<p>2 The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p>3 For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.</p>
<p>4 The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: he would not understand that he might do well.</p>
<p>5 He hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.</p>
<p>6 O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.</p>
<p>7 Thy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord:</p>
<p>8 O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of men shall put their trust under the cover of thy wings.</p>
<p>9 They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.</p>
<p>10 For with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall see light.</p>
<p>11 Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them that are right in heart.</p>
<p>12 Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner move me.</p>
<p>13 There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and could not stand.</p>
