<h1>Chapter 50</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm of David,</p>
<p>2 When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had sinned with Bethsabee.</p>
<p>3 Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.</p>
<p>4 Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p>5 For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.</p>
<p>6 To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p>7 For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me.</p>
<p>8 For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.</p>
<p>9 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.</p>
<p>10 To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.</p>
<p>11 Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>
<p>12 Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit within my bowels.</p>
<p>13 Cast me not away from thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>
<p>14 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.</p>
<p>15 I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be converted to thee.</p>
<p>16 Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall extol thy justice.</p>
<p>17 O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy praise.</p>
<p>18 For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.</p>
<p>19 A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
<p>20 Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.</p>
<p>21 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.</p>
