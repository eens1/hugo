<h1>Chapter 148</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise ye him in the high places.</p>
<p>2 Praise ye him, all his angels, praise ye him, all his hosts.</p>
<p>3 Praise ye him, O sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.</p>
<p>4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens: and let all the waters that are above the heavens</p>
<p>5 Praise the name of the Lord. For he spoke, and they were made: he commanded, and they were created.</p>
<p>6 He hath established them for ever, and for ages of ages: he hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away.</p>
<p>7 Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all ye deeps:</p>
<p>8 Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which fulfil his word:</p>
<p>9 Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars:</p>
<p>10 Beasts and all cattle: serpents and feathered fowls:</p>
<p>11 Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the earth:</p>
<p>12 Young men and maidens: let the old with the younger, praise the name of the Lord:</p>
<p>13 For his name alone is exalted.</p>
<p>14 The praise of him is above heaven and earth: and he hath exalted the horn of his people. A hymn to all his saints to the children of Israel, a people approaching to him. Alleluia.</p>
