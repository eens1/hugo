<h1>Chapter 93</h1>

<p>1 The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: the God of revenge hath acted freely.</p>
<p>2 Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>
<p>3 How long shall sinners, O Lord: how long shall sinners glory?</p>
<p>4 Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: shall all speak who work injustice?</p>
<p>5 Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: and they have afflicted thy inheritance.</p>
<p>6 They have slain the widow and the stranger: and they have murdered the fatherless.</p>
<p>7 And they have said: The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob understand.</p>
<p>8 Understand, ye senseless among the people: and, you fools, be wise at last.</p>
<p>9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider?</p>
<p>10 He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: he that teacheth man knowledge?</p>
<p>11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain.</p>
<p>12 Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct, O Lord: and shalt teach him out of thy law.</p>
<p>13 That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: till a pit be dug for the wicked.</p>
<p>14 For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he forsake his own inheritance.</p>
<p>15 Until justice be turned into judgment: and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.</p>
<p>16 Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? or who shall stand with me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p>17 Unless the Lord had been my helper, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.</p>
<p>18 If I said: My foot is moved: thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.</p>
<p>19 According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy comforts have given joy to my soul.</p>
<p>20 Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, who framest labour in commandment?</p>
<p>21 They will hunt after the soul of the just, and will condemn innocent blood.</p>
<p>22 But the Lord is my refuge: and my God the help of my hope.</p>
<p>23 And he will render them their iniquity : and in their malice he will destroy them: the Lord our God will destroy them.</p>
