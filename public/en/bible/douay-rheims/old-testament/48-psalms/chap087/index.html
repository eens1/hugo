<h1>Chapter 87</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for Maheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite.</p>
<p>2 O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee.</p>
<p>3 Let my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition.</p>
<p>4 For my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.</p>
<p>5 I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a man without help,</p>
<p>6 Free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>
<p>7 They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.</p>
<p>8 Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.</p>
<p>9 Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth:</p>
<p>10 My eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee.</p>
<p>11 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?</p>
<p>12 Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth in destruction?</p>
<p>13 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?</p>
<p>14 But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.</p>
<p>15 Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy face from me?</p>
<p>16 I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have been humbled and troubled.</p>
<p>17 Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me.</p>
<p>18 They have come round about me like water all the day: they have compassed me about together.</p>
<p>19 Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my acquaintance, because of misery.</p>
