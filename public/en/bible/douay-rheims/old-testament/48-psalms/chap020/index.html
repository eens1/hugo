<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly.</p>
<p>3 Thou hast given him his heart&rsquo;s desire: and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips.</p>
<p>4 For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.</p>
<p>5 He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.</p>
<p>6 His glory is great in thy salvation: glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon him.</p>
<p>7 For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.</p>
<p>8 For the king hopeth in the Lord: and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>
<p>9 Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.</p>
<p>10 Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour them.</p>
<p>11 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: and their seed from among the children of men.</p>
<p>12 For they have intended evils against thee: they have devised counsels which they have not been able to establish.</p>
<p>13 For thou shalt make them turn their back: in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face.</p>
<p>14 Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: we will sing and praise thy power.</p>
