<h1>Chapter 134</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Alleluia. Praise ye the name of the Lord: O you his servants, praise the Lord:</p>
<p>2 You that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.</p>
<p>3 Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: sing ye to his name, for it is sweet.</p>
<p>4 For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: Israel for his own possession.</p>
<p>5 For I have known that the Lord is great, and our God is above all gods.</p>
<p>6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done, in heaven, in earth, in the sea, and in all the deeps.</p>
<p>7 He bringeth up clouds from the end of the earth: he hath made lightnings for the rain. He bringeth forth winds out of his stores:</p>
<p>8 He slew the firstborn of Egypt from man even unto beast.</p>
<p>9 He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt: upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.</p>
<p>10 He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:</p>
<p>11 Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan.</p>
<p>12 And gave their land for an inheritance, for an inheritance to his people Israel.</p>
<p>13 Thy name, O Lord, is for ever: thy memorial, O Lord, unto all generations.</p>
<p>14 For the Lord will judge his people, and will be entreated in favour of his servants.</p>
<p>15 The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of men&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>16 They have a mouth, but they speak not: they have eyes, but they see not.</p>
<p>17 They have ears, but they hear not: neither is there any breath in their mouths.</p>
<p>18 Let them that make them be like to them: and every one that trusteth in them.</p>
<p>19 Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron.</p>
<p>20 Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: you that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.</p>
<p>21 Blessed be the Lord out of Sion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem.</p>
