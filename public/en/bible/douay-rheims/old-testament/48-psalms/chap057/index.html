<h1>Chapter 57</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a title.</p>
<p>2 If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of men.</p>
<p>3 For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in the earth.</p>
<p>4 The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: they have spoken false things.</p>
<p>5 Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:</p>
<p>6 Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.</p>
<p>7 God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.</p>
<p>8 They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.</p>
<p>9 Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.</p>
<p>10 Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up, as alive, in his wrath.</p>
<p>11 The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.</p>
<p>12 And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.</p>
