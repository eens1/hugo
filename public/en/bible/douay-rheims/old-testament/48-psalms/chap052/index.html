<h1>Chapter 52</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David. The fool said in his heart: There is no God.</p>
<p>2 They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that doth good.</p>
<p>3 God looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.</p>
<p>4 All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, there is none that doth good, no not one.</p>
<p>5 Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they eat bread?</p>
<p>6 They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.</p>
<p>7 Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
