<h1>Chapter 34</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me.</p>
<p>2 Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me.</p>
<p>3 Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation.</p>
<p>4 Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me.</p>
<p>5 Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord straiten them.</p>
<p>6 Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.</p>
<p>7 For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul.</p>
<p>8 Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall.</p>
<p>9 But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation.</p>
<p>10 All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him.</p>
<p>11 Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.</p>
<p>12 They repaid me evil for good: to the depriving me of my soul.</p>
<p>13 But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.</p>
<p>14 As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.</p>
<p>15 But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.</p>
<p>16 They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
<p>17 Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.</p>
<p>18 I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people.</p>
<p>19 Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.</p>
<p>20 For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.</p>
<p>21 And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.</p>
<p>22 Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not from me.</p>
<p>23 Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and my Lord.</p>
<p>24 Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me.</p>
<p>25 Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.</p>
<p>26 Let them blush: and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me.</p>
<p>27 Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.</p>
<p>28 And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long.</p>
