<h1>Chapter 63</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.</p>
<p>3 Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>4 For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,</p>
<p>5 To shoot in secret the undefiled.</p>
<p>6 They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?</p>
<p>7 They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart:</p>
<p>8 And God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:</p>
<p>9 And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled;</p>
<p>10 And every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God, and understood his doings.</p>
<p>11 The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised.</p>
