<h1>Chapter 88</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Of understanding, for Ethan the Ezrahite.</p>
<p>2 The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation.</p>
<p>3 For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them.</p>
<p>4 I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant:</p>
<p>5 Thy seed will I settle for ever. And I will build up thy throne unto generation and generation.</p>
<p>6 The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: and thy truth in the church of the saints.</p>
<p>7 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among the sons of God shall be like to God?</p>
<p>8 God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and terrible above all them that are about him.</p>
<p>9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.</p>
<p>10 Thou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.</p>
<p>11 Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.</p>
<p>12 Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded:</p>
<p>13 The north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name:</p>
<p>14 Thy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted:</p>
<p>15 Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and truth shall go before thy face:</p>
<p>16 Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance:</p>
<p>17 And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted.</p>
<p>18 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted.</p>
<p>19 For our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one of Israel.</p>
<p>20 Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.</p>
<p>21 I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed him.</p>
<p>22 For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.</p>
<p>23 The enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.</p>
<p>24 And I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that hate him I will put to flight.</p>
<p>25 And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
<p>26 And I will set his hand in the sea; and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
<p>27 He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the support of my salvation.</p>
<p>28 And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>29 I will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful to him.</p>
<p>30 And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
<p>31 And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:</p>
<p>32 If they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments:</p>
<p>33 I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with stripes.</p>
<p>34 But my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my truth to fail.</p>
<p>35 Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.</p>
<p>36 Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</p>
<p>37 His seed shall endure for ever.</p>
<p>38 And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</p>
<p>39 But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with my anointed.</p>
<p>40 Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</p>
<p>41 Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength fear.</p>
<p>42 All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
<p>43 Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
<p>44 Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not assisted him in battle.</p>
<p>45 Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p>46 Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him with confusion.</p>
<p>47 How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger burn like fire?</p>
<p>48 Remember what my substance is: for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?</p>
<p>49 Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?</p>
<p>50 Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?</p>
<p>51 Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have held in my bosom) of many nations:</p>
<p>52 Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.</p>
<p>53 Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.</p>
