<h1>Chapter 32</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 A psalm for David. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: praise becometh the upright.</p>
<p>2 Give praise to the Lord on the harp; sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.</p>
<p>3 Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.</p>
<p>4 For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done with faithfulness.</p>
<p>5 He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:</p>
<p>7 Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying up the depths in storehouses.</p>
<p>8 Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.</p>
<p>9 For he spoke and they were made: he commanded and they were created.</p>
<p>10 The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.</p>
<p>11 But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
<p>12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.</p>
<p>13 The Lord hath looked from heaven: he hath beheld all the sons of men.</p>
<p>14 From his habitation which he hath prepared, he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth.</p>
<p>15 He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: who understandeth all their works.</p>
<p>16 The king is not saved by a great army: nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.</p>
<p>17 Vain is the horse for safety: neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.</p>
<p>18 Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: and on them that hope in his mercy.</p>
<p>19 To deliver their souls from death; and feed them in famine.</p>
<p>20 Our soul waiteth for the Lord: for he is our helper and protector.</p>
<p>21 For in him our heart shall rejoice: and in his holy name we have trusted.</p>
<p>22 Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in thee.</p>
