<h1>Chapter 49</h1>

<p>1 A psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: and he hath called the earth. From the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof:</p>
<p>2 Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.</p>
<p>3 God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. A fire shall burn before him: and a mighty tempest shall be round about him.</p>
<p>4 He shall call heaven from above, and the earth, to judge his people.</p>
<p>5 Gather ye together his saints to him: who set his covenant before sacrifices.</p>
<p>6 And the heavens shall declare his justice: for God is judge.</p>
<p>7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God.</p>
<p>8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: and thy burnt offerings are always in my sight.</p>
<p>9 I will not take calves out of thy house: nor he goats out of thy flocks.</p>
<p>10 For all the beasts of the woods are mine: the cattle on the hills, and the oxen.</p>
<p>11 I know all the fowls of the air: and with me is the beauty of the field.</p>
<p>12 If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>13 Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p>14 Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the most High.</p>
<p>15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
<p>16 But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>
<p>17 Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind thee.</p>
<p>18 If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou hast been a partaker.</p>
<p>19 Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.</p>
<p>20 Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a scandal against thy mother&rsquo;s son:</p>
<p>21 These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set before thy face.</p>
<p>22 Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you away, and there be none to deliver you.</p>
<p>23 The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way by which I will shew him the salvation of God.</p>
