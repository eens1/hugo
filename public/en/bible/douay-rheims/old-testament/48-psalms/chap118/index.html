<h1>Chapter 118</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.</p>
<p>2 Blessed are they that search his testimonies: that seek him with their whole heart.</p>
<p>3 For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways.</p>
<p>4 Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently.</p>
<p>5 O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications.</p>
<p>6 Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy commandments.</p>
<p>7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice.</p>
<p>8 I will keep thy justifications: O! do not thou utterly forsake me.</p>
<p>9 By what doth a young man correct his way? by observing thy words.</p>
<p>10 With my whole heart have I sought after thee: let me not stray from thy commandments.</p>
<p>11 Thy words have I hidden in my heart, that I may not sin against thee.</p>
<p>12 Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>13 With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>
<p>14 I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches.</p>
<p>15 I will meditate on thy commandments: and I will consider thy ways.</p>
<p>16 I will think of thy justifications: I will not forget thy words.</p>
<p>17 Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: and I shall keep thy words.</p>
<p>18 Open thou my eyes: and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law.</p>
<p>19 I am a sojourner on the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
<p>20 My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, at all times.</p>
<p>21 Thou hast rebuked the proud: they are cursed who decline from thy commandments.</p>
<p>22 Remove from me reproach and contempt: because I have sought after thy testimonies.</p>
<p>23 For princes sat, and spoke against me: but thy servant was employed in thy justifications.</p>
<p>24 For thy testimonies are my meditation: and thy justifications my counsel.</p>
<p>25 My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p>26 I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>27 Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: and I shall be exercised in thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>28 My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: strengthen thou me in thy words.</p>
<p>29 Remove from me the way of iniquity: and out of thy law have mercy on me.</p>
<p>30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments I have not forgotten.</p>
<p>31 I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: put me not to shame.</p>
<p>32 I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge my heart.</p>
<p>33 Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: and I will always seek after it.</p>
<p>34 Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; and I will keep it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>35 Lead me into the path of thy commandments; for this same I have desired.</p>
<p>36 Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness.</p>
<p>37 Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in thy way.</p>
<p>38 Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy fear.</p>
<p>39 Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: for thy judgments are delightful.</p>
<p>40 Behold I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy justice.</p>
<p>41 Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: thy salvation according to thy word.</p>
<p>42 So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; that I have trusted in thy words.</p>
<p>43 And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.</p>
<p>44 So shall I always keep thy law, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>45 And I walked at large: because I have sought after thy commandments.</p>
<p>46 And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: and I was not ashamed.</p>
<p>47 I meditated also on thy commandments, which I loved.</p>
<p>48 And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: and I was exercised in thy justifications.</p>
<p>49 Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, in which thou hast given me hope.</p>
<p>50 This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath enlivened me.</p>
<p>51 The proud did iniquitously altogether: but I declined not from thy law.</p>
<p>52 I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: and I was comforted.</p>
<p>53 A fainting hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
<p>54 Thy justifications were the subject of my song, in the place of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>55 In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: and have kept thy law.</p>
<p>56 This happened to me: because I sought after thy justifications.</p>
<p>57 O Lord, my portion, I have said, I would keep thy law.</p>
<p>58 I entreated thy face with all my heart: have mercy on me according to thy word.</p>
<p>59 I have thought on my ways: and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
<p>60 I am ready, and am not troubled: that I may keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>61 The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p>62 I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; for the judgments of thy justification.</p>
<p>63 I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, and that keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>65 Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word.</p>
<p>66 Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
<p>67 Before I was humbled I offended; therefore have I kept thy word.</p>
<p>68 Thou art good; and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>69 The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.</p>
<p>70 Their heart is curdled like milk: but I have meditated on thy law.</p>
<p>71 It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, that I may learn thy justifications.</p>
<p>72 The law of thy mouth is good to me, above thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p>73 Thy hands have made me and formed me: give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments.</p>
<p>74 They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad : because I have greatly hoped in thy words.</p>
<p>75 I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: and in thy truth thou hast humbled me.</p>
<p>76 O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
<p>77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: for thy law is my meditation.</p>
<p>78 Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: but I will be employed in thy commandments.</p>
<p>79 Let them that fear thee turn to me: and they that know thy testimonies.</p>
<p>80 Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, that I may not be confounded.</p>
<p>81 My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: and in thy word I have very much hoped.</p>
<p>82 My eyes have failed for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
<p>83 For I am become like a bottle in the frost: I have not forgotten thy justifications.</p>
<p>84 How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
<p>85 The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law.</p>
<p>86 All thy statutes are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly, do thou help me.</p>
<p>87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I have not forsaken thy commandments.</p>
<p>88 Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth.</p>
<p>89 For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven.</p>
<p>90 Thy truth unto all generations: thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth.</p>
<p>91 By thy ordinance the day goeth on: for all things serve thee.</p>
<p>92 Unless thy law had been my meditation, I had then perhaps perished in my abjection.</p>
<p>93 Thy justifications I will never forget: for by them thou hast given me life.</p>
<p>94 I am thine, save thou me: for I have sought thy justifications.</p>
<p>95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I have understood thy testimonies.</p>
<p>96 I have seen an end of all perfection: thy commandment is exceeding broad.</p>
<p>97 O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
<p>98 Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: for it is ever with me.</p>
<p>99 I have understood more than all my teachers: because thy testimonies are my meditation.</p>
<p>100 I have had understanding above ancients: because I have sought thy commandments.</p>
<p>101 I have restrained my feet from every evil way: that I may keep thy words.</p>
<p>102 I have not declined from thy judgments, because thou hast set me a law.</p>
<p>103 How sweet are thy words to my palate! more than honey to my mouth.</p>
<p>104 By thy commandments I have had understanding: therefore have I hated every way of iniquity.</p>
<p>105 Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.</p>
<p>106 I have sworn and am determined to keep the judgments of thy justice.</p>
<p>107 I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p>108 The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: and teach me thy judgments.</p>
<p>109 My soul is continually in my hands: and I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p>110 Sinners have laid a snare for me: but I have not erred from thy precepts.</p>
<p>111 I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever: because they are the joy of my heart.</p>
<p>112 I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, for the reward.</p>
<p>113 I have hated the unjust: and have loved thy law.</p>
<p>114 Thou art my helper and my protector: and in thy word I have greatly hoped.</p>
<p>115 Depart from me, ye malignant: and I will search the commandments of my God.</p>
<p>116 Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: and let me not be confounded in my expectation.</p>
<p>117 Help me, and I shall be saved: and I will meditate always on thy justifications.</p>
<p>118 Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments; for their thought is unjust.</p>
<p>119 I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators: therefore have I loved thy testimonies.</p>
<p>120 Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: for I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
<p>121 I have done judgment and justice: give me not up to them that slander me.</p>
<p>122 Uphold thy servant unto good: let not the proud calumniate me.</p>
<p>123 My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: and for the word of thy justice.</p>
<p>124 Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: and teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>125 I am thy servant: give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p>126 It is time, O Lord, to do: they have dissipated thy law.</p>
<p>127 Therefore have I loved thy commandments above gold and the topaz.</p>
<p>128 Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: I have hated all wicked ways.</p>
<p>129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore my soul hath sought them.</p>
<p>130 The declaration of thy words giveth light: and giveth understanding to little ones.</p>
<p>131 I opened my mouth, and panted: because I longed for thy commandments.</p>
<p>132 Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me according to the judgment of them that love thy name.</p>
<p>133 Direct my steps according to thy word: and let no iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p>134 Redeem me from the calumnies of men: that I may keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: and teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>136 My eyes have sent forth springs of water: because they have not kept thy law.</p>
<p>137 Thou art just, O Lord: and thy judgment is right.</p>
<p>138 Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: and thy truth exceedingly.</p>
<p>139 My zeal hath made me pine away: because my enemies forgot thy words.</p>
<p>140 Thy word is exceedingly refined: and thy servant hath loved it.</p>
<p>141 I am very young and despised; but I forget not thy justifications.</p>
<p>142 Thy justice is justice for ever: and thy law is the truth.</p>
<p>143 Trouble and anguish have found me: thy commandments are my meditation.</p>
<p>144 Thy testimonies are justice for ever: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
<p>145 I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: I will seek thy justifications.</p>
<p>146 I cried unto thee, save me: that I may keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>147 I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: because in thy words I very much hoped.</p>
<p>148 My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: that I might meditate on thy words.</p>
<p>149 Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: and quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
<p>150 They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; but they are gone far off from thy law.</p>
<p>151 Thou art near, O Lord: and all thy ways are truth.</p>
<p>152 I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies: that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
<p>153 See my humiliation and deliver me for I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p>154 Judge my judgment and redeem me: quicken thou me for thy word&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>155 Salvation is far from sinners; because they have not sought thy justifications.</p>
<p>156 Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
<p>157 Many are they that persecute me and afflict me; but I have not declined from thy testimonies.</p>
<p>158 I beheld the transgressors, and pined away; because they kept not thy word.</p>
<p>159 Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; quicken me thou in thy mercy.</p>
<p>160 The beginning of thy words is truth: all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.</p>
<p>161 Princes have persecuted me without cause: and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.</p>
<p>162 I will rejoice at thy words, as one that hath found great spoil.</p>
<p>163 I have hated and abhorred iniquity; but I have loved thy law.</p>
<p>164 Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, for the judgments of thy justice.</p>
<p>165 Much peace have they that love thy law, and to them there is no stumbling block.</p>
<p>166 I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: and I loved thy commandments.</p>
<p>167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies and hath loved them exceedingly.</p>
<p>168 I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: because all my ways are in thy sight.</p>
<p>169 Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>
<p>170 Let my request come in before thee; deliver thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p>171 My lips shall utter a hymn, when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.</p>
<p>172 My tongue shall pronounce thy word: because all thy commandments are justice.</p>
<p>173 Let thy hand be with me to save me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>
<p>174 I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my meditation.</p>
<p>175 My soul shall live and shall praise thee: and thy judgments shall help me.</p>
<p>176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.</p>
