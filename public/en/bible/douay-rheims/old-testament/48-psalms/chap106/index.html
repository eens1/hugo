<h1>Chapter 106</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>2 Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.</p>
<p>3 From the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.</p>
<p>4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.</p>
<p>5 They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p>6 And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>7 And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p>8 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
<p>9 For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.</p>
<p>10 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron.</p>
<p>11 Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p>12 And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened, and there was none to help them.</p>
<p>13 Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>14 And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder.</p>
<p>15 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
<p>16 Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.</p>
<p>17 He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were brought low for their injustices.</p>
<p>18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.</p>
<p>19 And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>20 He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
<p>21 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
<p>22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his works with joy.</p>
<p>23 They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters:</p>
<p>24 These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p>25 He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up.</p>
<p>26 They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: their soul pined away with evils.</p>
<p>27 They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up.</p>
<p>28 And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>29 And he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still.</p>
<p>30 And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.</p>
<p>31 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
<p>32 And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients.</p>
<p>33 He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of waters into dry ground:</p>
<p>34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>35 He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land into water springs.</p>
<p>36 And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation.</p>
<p>37 And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded fruit of birth.</p>
<p>38 And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.</p>
<p>39 Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.</p>
<p>40 Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.</p>
<p>41 And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>42 The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p>43 Who is wise, and will keep these things; and will understand the mercies of the Lord?</p>
