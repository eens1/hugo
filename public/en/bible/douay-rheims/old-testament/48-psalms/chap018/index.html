<h1>Chapter 18</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end. A Psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.</p>
<p>3 Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge.</p>
<p>4 There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not heard.</p>
<p>5 Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the world.</p>
<p>6 He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: and he as a bridegroom coming out of his bridechamber, Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way:</p>
<p>7 His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to the end thereof: and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.</p>
<p>8 The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.</p>
<p>9 The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.</p>
<p>10 The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.</p>
<p>11 More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p>12 For thy servant keepeth them, and in keeping them there is a great reward.</p>
<p>13 Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord:</p>
<p>14 And from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.</p>
<p>15 And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper and my Redeemer.</p>
