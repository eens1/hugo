<h1>Chapter 80</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself.</p>
<p>2 Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>3 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery with the harp.</p>
<p>4 Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your solemnity.</p>
<p>5 For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>6 He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.</p>
<p>7 He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in baskets.</p>
<p>8 Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction.</p>
<p>9 Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me,</p>
<p>10 there shall be no new god in thee: neither shalt thou adore a strange god.</p>
<p>11 For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p>12 But my people heard not my voice: and Israel hearkened not to me.</p>
<p>13 So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they shall walk in their own inventions.</p>
<p>14 If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways:</p>
<p>15 I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on them that troubled them.</p>
<p>16 The enemies of the Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be for ever.</p>
<p>17 And he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey out of the rock.</p>
