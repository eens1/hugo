<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.</p>
<p>2 Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.</p>
<p>3 Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.</p>
<p>4 That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</p>
<p>5 Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved.</p>
<p>6 I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.</p>
<p>7 Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.</p>
<p>8 From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.</p>
<p>9 From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul:</p>
<p>10 They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.</p>
<p>11 They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.</p>
<p>12 They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.</p>
<p>13 Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword</p>
<p>14 From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.</p>
<p>15 But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.</p>
