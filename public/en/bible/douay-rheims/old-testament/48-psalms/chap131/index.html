<h1>Chapter 131</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A gradual canticle. O Lord, remember David, and all his meekness.</p>
<p>2 How he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob:</p>
<p>3 If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go up into the bed wherein I lie:</p>
<p>4 If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,</p>
<p>5 Or rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>6 Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the fields of the wood.</p>
<p>7 We will go into his tabernacle: we will adore in the place where his feet stood.</p>
<p>8 Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which thou hast sanctified.</p>
<p>9 Let thy priests be clothed with justice: and let thy saints rejoice.</p>
<p>10 For thy servant David&rsquo;s sake, turn not away the face of thy anointed.</p>
<p>11 The Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not make it void: of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne.</p>
<p>12 If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them: Their children also for evermore shall sit upon thy throne.</p>
<p>13 For the Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for his dwelling.</p>
<p>14 This is my rest for ever and ever: here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.</p>
<p>15 Blessing I will bless her widow: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
<p>16 I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with exceeding great joy.</p>
<p>17 There will I bring forth a horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.</p>
<p>18 His enemies I will clothe with confusion: but upon him shall my sanctification flourish.</p>
