<h1>Chapter 71</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm on Solomon.</p>
<p>2 Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king&rsquo;s son thy justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.</p>
<p>3 Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the hills justice.</p>
<p>4 He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.</p>
<p>5 And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon, throughout all generations.</p>
<p>6 He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.</p>
<p>7 In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away.</p>
<p>8 And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>9 Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall lick the ground.</p>
<p>10 The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:</p>
<p>11 And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him.</p>
<p>12 For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that had no helper.</p>
<p>13 He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor.</p>
<p>14 He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their names shall be honourable in his sight.</p>
<p>15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the day.</p>
<p>16 And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.</p>
<p>17 Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all nations shall magnify him.</p>
<p>18 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful things.</p>
<p>19 And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.</p>
<p>20 The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.</p>
