<h1>Chapter 58</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, destroy not, for David for an inscription of a title, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him.</p>
<p>2 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; and defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>
<p>3 Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</p>
<p>4 For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in upon me:</p>
<p>5 Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.</p>
<p>6 Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.</p>
<p>7 They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger like dogs: and shall go round about the city.</p>
<p>8 Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: for who, say they, hath heard us?</p>
<p>9 But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.</p>
<p>10 I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector:</p>
<p>11 My God, his mercy shall prevent me.</p>
<p>12 God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, lest at any time my people forget. Scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord, my protector:</p>
<p>13 For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: and let them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of,</p>
<p>14 When they are consumed: when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and all the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>15 They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs: and shall go round about the city.</p>
<p>16 They shall be scattered abroad to eat, and shall murmur if they be not filled.</p>
<p>17 But I will sing thy strength: and will extol thy mercy in the morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.</p>
<p>18 Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence: my God my mercy.</p>
