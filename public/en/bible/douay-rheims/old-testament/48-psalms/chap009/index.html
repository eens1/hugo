<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will relate all thy wonders.</p>
<p>3 I will be glad, and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high.</p>
<p>4 When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.</p>
<p>5 For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.</p>
<p>6 Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>7 The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:</p>
<p>8 But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment:</p>
<p>9 And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice.</p>
<p>10 And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.</p>
<p>11 And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.</p>
<p>12 Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among the Gentiles:</p>
<p>13 For requiring their blood, he hath remembered them: he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.</p>
<p>14 Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humiliation which I suffer from my enemies.</p>
<p>15 Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>
<p>16 I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the very snare which they hid.</p>
<p>17 The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.</p>
<p>18 The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p>19 For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>
<p>20 Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight.</p>
<p>21 Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men.</p>
<p>22 Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble?</p>
<p>23 Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise.</p>
<p>24 For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed.</p>
<p>25 The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him:</p>
<p>26 God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies.</p>
<p>27 For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.</p>
<p>28 His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labor and sorrow.</p>
<p>29 He sits in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent.</p>
<p>30 His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.</p>
<p>31 In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.</p>
<p>32 For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end.</p>
<p>33 Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</p>
<p>34 Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.</p>
<p>35 Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.</p>
<p>36 Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.</p>
<p>37 The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.</p>
<p>38 The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.</p>
<p>39 To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.</p>
