<h1>Chapter 128</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A gradual canticle. Often have they fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say.</p>
<p>2 Often have they fought against me from my youth: but they could not prevail over me.</p>
<p>3 The wicked have wrought upon my back: they have lengthened their iniquity.</p>
<p>4 The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners:</p>
<p>5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.</p>
<p>6 Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses: which withereth before it be plucked up:</p>
<p>7 Who with the mower filleth not his hand: nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.</p>
<p>8 And they that passed by have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.</p>
