<p>1 Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>
<p>2 Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication:</p>
<p>3 Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,</p>
<p>4 At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.</p>
<p>5 My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.</p>
<p>6 Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</p>
<p>7 And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?</p>
<p>8 Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.</p>
<p>9 I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.</p>
<p>10 Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.</p>
<p>11 Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,</p>
<p>12 And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.</p>
<p>13 For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden my self from him.</p>
<p>14 But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,</p>
<p>15 Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.</p>
<p>16 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</p>
<p>17 But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</p>
<p>18 Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p>19 He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.</p>
<p>20 God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:</p>
<p>21 He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,</p>
<p>22 They are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts.</p>
<p>23 Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.</p>
<p>24 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</p>
