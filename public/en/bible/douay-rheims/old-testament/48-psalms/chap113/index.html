<h1>Chapter 113</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:</p>
<p>2 Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>
<p>3 The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.</p>
<p>4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock.</p>
<p>5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?</p>
<p>6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?</p>
<p>7 At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob:</p>
<p>8 Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters.</p>
<p>9 Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.</p>
<p>10 For thy mercy, and for thy truth&rsquo;s sake: lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?</p>
<p>11 But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would.</p>
<p>12 The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men.</p>
<p>13 They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not.</p>
<p>14 They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not.</p>
<p>15 They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: neither shall they cry out through their throat.</p>
<p>16 Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as trust in them.</p>
<p>17 The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.</p>
<p>18 The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.</p>
<p>19 They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.</p>
<p>20 The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.</p>
<p>21 He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.</p>
<p>22 May the Lord add blessings upon you: upon you, and upon your children.</p>
<p>23 Blessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>24 The heaven of heaven is the Lord&rsquo;s: but the earth he has given to the children of men.</p>
<p>25 The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: nor any of them that go down to hell.</p>
<p>26 But we that live bless the Lord: from this time now and for ever.</p>
