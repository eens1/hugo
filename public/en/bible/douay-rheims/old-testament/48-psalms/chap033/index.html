<h1>Chapter 33</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For David, when he changed his countenance before Achimelech, who dismissed him, and he went his way.</p>
<p>2 I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be always in my mouth.</p>
<p>3 In the Lord shall my soul be praised: let the meek hear and rejoice.</p>
<p>4 O magnify the Lord with me; and let us extol his name together.</p>
<p>5 I sought the Lord, and he heard me; and he delivered me from all my troubles.</p>
<p>6 Come ye to him and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be confounded.</p>
<p>7 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
<p>8 The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: and shall deliver them.</p>
<p>9 O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man that hopeth in him.</p>
<p>10 Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</p>
<p>11 The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.</p>
<p>12 Come, children, hearken to me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>13 Who is the man that desireth life: who liveth to see good days?</p>
<p>14 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>
<p>15 Turn away from evil and do good: seek after peace and pursue it.</p>
<p>16 The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: and his ears unto their prayers.</p>
<p>17 But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
<p>18 The just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out of all their troubles.</p>
<p>19 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he will save the humble of spirit.</p>
<p>20 Many are the afflictions of the just; but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.</p>
<p>21 The Lord keepeth all their bones, not one of them shall be broken.</p>
<p>22 The death of the wicked is very evil: and they that hate the just shall be guilty.</p>
<p>23 The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall offend.</p>
