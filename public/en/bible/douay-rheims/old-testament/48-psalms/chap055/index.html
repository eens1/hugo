<h1>Chapter 55</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance from the sanctuary: for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when the Philistines held him in Geth.</p>
<p>2 Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.</p>
<p>3 My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many that make war against me.</p>
<p>4 From the height of the day I shall fear: but I will trust in thee.</p>
<p>5 In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: I will not fear what flesh can do against me.</p>
<p>6 All the day long they detested my words: all their thoughts were against me unto evil.</p>
<p>7 They will dwell and hide themselves: they will watch my heel. As they have waited for my soul,</p>
<p>8 For nothing shalt thou save them: in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces. O God,</p>
<p>9 I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set me tears in thy sight, As also in thy promise.</p>
<p>10 Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.</p>
<p>11 In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech. In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.</p>
<p>12 In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will pay, praises to thee:</p>
<p>13 Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling: that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.</p>
