<h1>Chapter 101</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The prayer of the poor man, when he was anxious, and poured out his supplication before the Lord.</p>
<p>2 Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.</p>
<p>3 Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily.</p>
<p>4 For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.</p>
<p>5 I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: because I forgot to eat my bread.</p>
<p>6 Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.</p>
<p>7 I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: I am like a night raven in the house.</p>
<p>8 I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.</p>
<p>9 All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised me did swear against me.</p>
<p>10 For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
<p>11 Because of thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up thou hast thrown me down.</p>
<p>12 My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.</p>
<p>13 But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy memorial to all generations.</p>
<p>14 Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have mercy on it, for the time is come.</p>
<p>15 For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall have pity on the earth thereof.</p>
<p>16 All the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
<p>17 For the Lord hath built up Sion: and he shall be seen in his glory.</p>
<p>18 He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not despised their petition.</p>
<p>19 Let these things be written unto another generation: and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:</p>
<p>20 Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.</p>
<p>21 That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that he might release the children of the slain:</p>
<p>22 That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
<p>23 When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>24 He answered him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the fewness of my days.</p>
<p>25 Call me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are unto generation and generation.</p>
<p>26 In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: and the heavens are the works of thy hands.</p>
<p>27 They shall perish but thou remainest: and all of them shall grow old like a garment: And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.</p>
<p>28 But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.</p>
<p>29 The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be directed for ever.</p>
