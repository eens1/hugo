<h1>Chapter 123</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A gradual canticle. If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say:</p>
<p>2 If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up against us,</p>
<p>3 Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was enkindled against us,</p>
<p>4 Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.</p>
<p>5 Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.</p>
<p>6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.</p>
<p>7 Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken, and we are delivered.</p>
<p>8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
