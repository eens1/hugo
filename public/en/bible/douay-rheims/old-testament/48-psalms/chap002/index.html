<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things?</p>
<p>2 The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
<p>3 Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us.</p>
<p>4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them.</p>
<p>5 Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage.</p>
<p>6 But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain, preaching his commandment.</p>
<p>7 The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p>8 Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
<p>9 Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter&rsquo;s vessel.</p>
<p>10 And now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you that judge the earth.</p>
<p>11 Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling.</p>
<p>12 Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way.</p>
<p>13 When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all they that trust in him.</p>
