<h1>Chapter 97</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm for David himself. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: because he hath done wonderful things. His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, and his arm is holy.</p>
<p>2 The Lord hath made known his salvation: he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
<p>4 Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and sing.</p>
<p>5 Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm:</p>
<p>6 With long trumpets, and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king:</p>
<p>7 Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>8 The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice together</p>
<p>9 At the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.</p>
