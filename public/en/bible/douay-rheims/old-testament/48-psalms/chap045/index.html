<h1>Chapter 45</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for the sons of Core, for the hidden.</p>
<p>2 Our God is our refuge and strength: a helper in troubles, which have found us exceedingly.</p>
<p>3 Therefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; and the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea.</p>
<p>4 Their waters roared and were troubled: the mountains were troubled with his strength.</p>
<p>5 The stream of the river maketh the city of God joyful: the most High hath sanctified his own tabernacle.</p>
<p>6 God is in the midst thereof, it shall not be moved: God will help it in the morning early.</p>
<p>7 Nations were troubled, and kingdoms were bowed down: he uttered his voice, the earth trembled.</p>
<p>8 The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.</p>
<p>9 Come and behold ye the works of the Lord: what wonders he hath done upon earth,</p>
<p>10 Making wars to cease even to the end of the earth. He shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons: and the shield he shall burn in the fire.</p>
<p>11 Be still and see that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p>12 The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.</p>
