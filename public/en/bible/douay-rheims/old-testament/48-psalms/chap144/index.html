<h1>Chapter 144</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Praise, for David himself. I will extol thee, O God my king: and I will bless thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>2 Every day will I bless thee: and I will praise thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>3 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of his greatness there is no end.</p>
<p>4 Generation and generation shall praise thy works: and they shall declare thy power.</p>
<p>5 They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness: and shall tell thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>6 And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and shall declare thy greatness.</p>
<p>7 They shall publish the memory of the abundance of thy sweetness: and shall rejoice in thy justice.</p>
<p>8 The Lord is gracious and merciful: patient and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p>9 The Lord is sweet to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
<p>10 Let all thy works, O Lord, praise thee: and let thy saints bless thee.</p>
<p>11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom: and shall tell of thy power:</p>
<p>12 To make thy might known to the sons of men: and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom.</p>
<p>13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages: and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. The Lord is faithful in all his words: and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>14 The Lord lifteth up all that fall: and setteth up all that are cast down.</p>
<p>15 The eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord: and thou givest them meat in due season.</p>
<p>16 Thou openest thy hand, and fillest with blessing every living creature.</p>
<p>17 The Lord is just in all his ways: and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>18 The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: to all that call upon him in truth.</p>
<p>19 He will do the will of them that fear him: and he will hear their prayer, and save them.</p>
<p>20 The Lord keepeth all them that love him; but all the wicked he will destroy.</p>
<p>21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name forever; yea, for ever and ever.</p>
