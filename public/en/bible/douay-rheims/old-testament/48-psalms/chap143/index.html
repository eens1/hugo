<h1>Chapter 143</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war.</p>
<p>2 My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me.</p>
<p>3 Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?</p>
<p>4 Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow.</p>
<p>5 Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>
<p>6 Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.</p>
<p>7 Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children:</p>
<p>8 Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.</p>
<p>9 To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.</p>
<p>10 Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword:</p>
<p>11 Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:</p>
<p>12 Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:</p>
<p>13 Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth:</p>
<p>14 Their oxen fat. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets.</p>
<p>15 They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.</p>
