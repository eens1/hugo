<h1>Chapter 90</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The praise of a canticle for David. He that dwelleth in the aid of the most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>2 He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: my God, in him will I trust.</p>
<p>3 For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: and from the sharp word.</p>
<p>4 He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: and under his wings thou shalt trust.</p>
<p>5 His truth shall compass thee with a shield: thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night.</p>
<p>6 Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh about in the dark: of invasion, or of the noonday devil.</p>
<p>7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>
<p>8 But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: and shalt see the reward of the wicked.</p>
<p>9 Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou hast made the most High thy refuge.</p>
<p>10 There shall no evil come to thee: nor shall the scourge come near thy dwelling.</p>
<p>11 For he hath given his angels charge over thee; to keep thee in all thy ways.</p>
<p>12 In their hands they shall bear thee up: lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon.</p>
<p>14 Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: I will protect him because he hath known my name.</p>
<p>15 He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I am with him in tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.</p>
<p>16 I will fill him with length of days; and I will shew him my salvation.</p>
