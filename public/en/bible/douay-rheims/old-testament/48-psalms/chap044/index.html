<h1>Chapter 44</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the sons of Core, for understanding. A canticle for the Beloved.</p>
<p>2 My heart hath uttered a good word: I speak my works to the king: My tongue is the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly.</p>
<p>3 Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.</p>
<p>4 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty.</p>
<p>5 With thy comeliness and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously, and reign. Because of truth and meekness and justice: and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.</p>
<p>6 Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, into the hearts of the king&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>7 Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.</p>
<p>8 Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
<p>9 Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: out of which</p>
<p>10 The daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory. The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with variety.</p>
<p>11 Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: and forget thy people and thy father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>12 And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore.</p>
<p>13 And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance.</p>
<p>14 All the glory of the king&rsquo;s daughter is within in golden borders,</p>
<p>15 Clothed round about with varieties. After her shall virgins be brought to the king: her neighbours shall be brought to thee.</p>
<p>16 They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: they shall be brought into the temple of the king.</p>
<p>17 Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.</p>
<p>18 They shall remember thy name throughout all generations. Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, for ever and ever.</p>
