<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The psalm of David, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of Chusi, the son of Jemini.</p>
<p>2 O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.</p>
<p>3 Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.</p>
<p>4 O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands:</p>
<p>5 If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.</p>
<p>6 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.</p>
<p>7 Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded:</p>
<p>8 And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high.</p>
<p>9 The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.</p>
<p>10 The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God. Just</p>
<p>11 Is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.</p>
<p>12 God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?</p>
<p>13 Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p>14 And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.</p>
<p>15 Behold he hath been in labour with injustice: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</p>
<p>16 He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into the hole he made.</p>
<p>17 His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.</p>
<p>18 I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: and will sing to the name of the Lord the most high.</p>
