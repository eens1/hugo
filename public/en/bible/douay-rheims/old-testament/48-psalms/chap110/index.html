<h1>Chapter 110</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council of the just, and in the congregation.</p>
<p>2 Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills.</p>
<p>3 His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever.</p>
<p>4 He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord:</p>
<p>5 He hath given food to them that fear him. He will be mindful for ever of his covenant:</p>
<p>6 He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.</p>
<p>7 That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works of his hands are truth and judgment.</p>
<p>8 All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity.</p>
<p>9 He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name:</p>
<p>10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and ever.</p>
