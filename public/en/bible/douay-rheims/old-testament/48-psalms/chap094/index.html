<h1>Chapter 94</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Come let us praise the Lord with joy: let us joyfully sing to God our saviour.</p>
<p>2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.</p>
<p>3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>4 For in his hand are all the ends of the earth: and the heights of the mountains are his.</p>
<p>5 For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</p>
<p>6 Come let us adore and fall down: and weep before the Lord that made us.</p>
<p>7 For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.</p>
<p>8 To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</p>
<p>9 As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness: where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my works.</p>
<p>10 Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said: These always err in heart.</p>
<p>11 And these men have not known my ways: so I swore in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest.</p>
