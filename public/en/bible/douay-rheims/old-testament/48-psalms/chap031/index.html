<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 To David himself, understanding. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
<p>2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</p>
<p>3 Because I was silent my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long.</p>
<p>4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.</p>
<p>5 I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed. I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.</p>
<p>6 For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
<p>7 Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.</p>
<p>8 I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee.</p>
<p>9 Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee.</p>
<p>10 Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart.</p>
