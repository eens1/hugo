<h1>Chapter 70</h1>

<p>1 A psalm for David. Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion:</p>
<p>2 Deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me. Incline thy ear unto me, and save me.</p>
<p>3 Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: that thou mayst make me safe. For thou art my firmament and my refuge.</p>
<p>4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.</p>
<p>5 For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth.</p>
<p>6 By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother&rsquo;s womb thou art my protector. Of thee I shall continually sing:</p>
<p>7 I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.</p>
<p>8 Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy greatness all the day long.</p>
<p>9 Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.</p>
<p>10 For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my soul have consulted together,</p>
<p>11 Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.</p>
<p>12 O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help.</p>
<p>13 Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt.</p>
<p>14 But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.</p>
<p>15 My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day long. Because I have not known learning,</p>
<p>16 I will enter into the powers of the Lord: O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.</p>
<p>17 Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.</p>
<p>18 And unto old age and grey hairs: O God, forsake me not, Until I shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come: Thy power,</p>
<p>19 And thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: O God, who is like to thee?</p>
<p>20 How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:</p>
<p>21 Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou hast comforted me.</p>
<p>22 For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of Israel.</p>
<p>23 My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my soul which thou hast redeemed.</p>
<p>24 Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.</p>
