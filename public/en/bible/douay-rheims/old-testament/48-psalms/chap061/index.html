<h1>Chapter 61</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.</p>
<p>2 Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.</p>
<p>3 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.</p>
<p>4 How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.</p>
<p>5 But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.</p>
<p>6 But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my patience.</p>
<p>7 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>8 In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.</p>
<p>9 Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him. God is our helper for ever.</p>
<p>10 But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances: that by vanity they may together deceive.</p>
<p>11 Trust not in iniquity, and covet not robberies: if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.</p>
<p>12 God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God,</p>
<p>13 And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.</p>
