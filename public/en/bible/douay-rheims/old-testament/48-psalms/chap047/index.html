<h1>Chapter 47</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm of a canticle, for the sons of Core, on the second day of the week.</p>
<p>2 Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</p>
<p>3 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.</p>
<p>4 In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.</p>
<p>5 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.</p>
<p>6 So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved:</p>
<p>7 Trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in labour.</p>
<p>8 With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.</p>
<p>9 As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.</p>
<p>10 We have received thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>
<p>11 According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of justice.</p>
<p>12 Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; because of thy judgments, O Lord.</p>
<p>13 Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell ye in her towers.</p>
<p>14 Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, that ye may relate it in another generation.</p>
<p>15 For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he shall rule us for evermore.</p>
