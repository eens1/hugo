<h1>Chapter 103</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:</p>
<p>2 And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:</p>
<p>3 Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.</p>
<p>4 Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</p>
<p>5 Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever.</p>
<p>6 The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand.</p>
<p>7 At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.</p>
<p>8 The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p>9 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.</p>
<p>10 Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.</p>
<p>11 All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.</p>
<p>12 Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.</p>
<p>13 Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:</p>
<p>14 Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</p>
<p>15 And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>16 The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:</p>
<p>17 There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron.</p>
<p>18 The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.</p>
<p>19 He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p>20 Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:</p>
<p>21 The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.</p>
<p>22 The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall lie down in their dens.</p>
<p>23 Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p>24 How great are thy works, O Lord ? thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.</p>
<p>25 So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.</p>
<p>26 There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.</p>
<p>27 All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.</p>
<p>28 What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.</p>
<p>29 But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.</p>
<p>30 Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</p>
<p>31 May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p>32 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he troubleth the mountains, and they smoke.</p>
<p>33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p>34 Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in the Lord.</p>
<p>35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>
