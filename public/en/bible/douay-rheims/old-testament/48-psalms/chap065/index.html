<h1>Chapter 65</h1>

<p>1 Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection. Shout with joy to God, all the earth,</p>
<p>2 Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.</p>
<p>3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.</p>
<p>4 Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a psalm to thy name.</p>
<p>5 Come and see the works of God; who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men.</p>
<p>6 Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on foot: there shall we rejoice in him.</p>
<p>7 Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.</p>
<p>8 O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to be heard.</p>
<p>9 Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be moved:</p>
<p>10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.</p>
<p>11 Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on our back:</p>
<p>12 Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.</p>
<p>13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p>
<p>14 Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p>
<p>15 I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt offerings of rams: I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.</p>
<p>16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my soul.</p>
<p>17 I cried to him with my mouth: and I extolled him with my tongue.</p>
<p>18 If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</p>
<p>19 Therefore hath God heard me, and hath attended to the voice of my supplication.</p>
<p>20 Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>
