<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The psalm of David before he was anointed. The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
<p>2 Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.</p>
<p>3 If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.</p>
<p>4 One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</p>
<p>5 For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</p>
<p>6 He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.</p>
<p>7 Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.</p>
<p>8 My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.</p>
<p>9 Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.</p>
<p>10 For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.</p>
<p>11 Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.</p>
<p>12 Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.</p>
<p>13 I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
<p>14 Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.</p>
