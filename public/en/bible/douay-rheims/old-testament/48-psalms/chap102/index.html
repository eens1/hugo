<h1>Chapter 102</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within me bless his holy name.</p>
<p>2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee.</p>
<p>3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.</p>
<p>4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.</p>
<p>5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>6 The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.</p>
<p>7 He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children of Israel.</p>
<p>8 The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p>9 He will not always be angry: nor will he threaten for ever.</p>
<p>10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p>11 For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.</p>
<p>12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.</p>
<p>13 As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him:</p>
<p>14 For he knoweth our frame. He remembereth that we are dust:</p>
<p>15 Man&rsquo;s days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.</p>
<p>16 For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: and he shall know his place no more.</p>
<p>17 But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity upon them that fear him: And his justice unto children&rsquo;s children,</p>
<p>18 To such as keep his covenant, And are mindful of his commandments to do them.</p>
<p>19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: and his kingdom shall rule over all.</p>
<p>20 Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.</p>
<p>21 Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: you ministers of his that do his will.</p>
<p>22 Bless the Lord, all his works: in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>
