<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I myself am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.</p>
<p>2 In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.</p>
<p>3 And being born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.</p>
<p>4 I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.</p>
<p>5 For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.</p>
<p>6 For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.</p>
<p>7 Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:</p>
<p>8 And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.</p>
<p>9 Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold, in comparison of her, is as a little sand; and silver, in respect to her, shall be counted as clay.</p>
<p>10 I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.</p>
<p>11 Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,</p>
<p>12 And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all.</p>
<p>13 Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.</p>
<p>14 For she is an infinite treasure to men: which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts of discipline.</p>
<p>15 And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:</p>
<p>16 For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.</p>
<p>17 For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,</p>
<p>18 The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,</p>
<p>19 The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,</p>
<p>20 The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,</p>
<p>21 And all such things as are hid, and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.</p>
<p>22 For in her is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,</p>
<p>23 Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits: intelligible, pure, subtile:</p>
<p>24 For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere, by reason of her purity.</p>
<p>25 For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emmanation of the glory of the Almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.</p>
<p>26 For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God&rsquo;s majesty, and the image of his goodness.</p>
<p>27 And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.</p>
<p>28 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</p>
<p>29 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</p>
<p>30 For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.</p>
