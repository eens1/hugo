<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them.</p>
<p>2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure was taken for misery:</p>
<p>3 And their going away from us, for utter destruction: but they are in peace.</p>
<p>4 And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.</p>
<p>5 Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.</p>
<p>6 As gold in the furnace, he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust, he hath received them, and in time there shall be respect had to them.</p>
<p>7 The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds.</p>
<p>8 They shall judge nations, and rule over people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.</p>
<p>9 They that trust in him shall understand the truth: and they that are faithful in love, shall rest in him: for grace and peace are to his elect.</p>
<p>10 But the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices: who have neglected the just, and have revolted from the Lord.</p>
<p>11 For he that rejecteth wisdom, and discipline, is unhappy: and their hope is vain, and their labours without fruit, and their works unprofitable.</p>
<p>12 Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked.</p>
<p>13 Their offspring is cursed, for happy is the barren: and the undefiled, that hath not known bed in sin, she shall have fruit in the visitation of holy souls.</p>
<p>14 And the eunuch, that hath not wrought iniquity with his hands, nor thought wicked things against God for the precious gift of faith shall be given to him, and a most acceptable lot in the temple of God.</p>
<p>15 For the fruit of good labours is glorious, and the root of wisdom never faileth.</p>
<p>16 But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, and the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out.</p>
<p>17 And if they live long, they shall be nothing regarded, and their last old age shall be without honour.</p>
<p>18 And if they die quickly, they shall have no hope, nor speech of comfort in the day of trial.</p>
<p>19 For dreadful are the ends of a wicked race.</p>
