<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 How beautiful is the chaste generation with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both with God and with men.</p>
<p>2 When it is present, they imitate it: and they desire it, when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.</p>
<p>3 But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.</p>
<p>4 And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.</p>
<p>5 For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.</p>
<p>6 For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.</p>
<p>7 But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.</p>
<p>8 For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.</p>
<p>9 And a spotless life is old age.</p>
<p>10 He pleased God, and was beloved, and living among sinners, he was translated.</p>
<p>11 He was taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.</p>
<p>12 For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things, and the wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind.</p>
<p>13 Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time.</p>
<p>14 For his soul pleased God: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:</p>
<p>15 That the grace of God, and his mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.</p>
<p>16 But the just that is dead, condemneth the wicked that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust.</p>
<p>17 For they shall see the end of the wise man, and it shall not understand what God hath designed for him, and why the Lord hath set him in safety.</p>
<p>18 They shall see him, and shall despise him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.</p>
<p>19 And they shall fall after this without honour, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.</p>
<p>20 They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them.</p>
