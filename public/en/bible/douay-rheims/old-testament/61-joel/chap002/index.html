<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because the day of the Lord cometh, because it is nigh at hand.</p>
<p>2 A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the mountains: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, nor shall be after it, even to the years of generation and generation.</p>
<p>3 Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can escape it.</p>
<p>4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen.</p>
<p>5 They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle.</p>
<p>6 At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a kettle.</p>
<p>7 They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks.</p>
<p>8 No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm.</p>
<p>9 They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows, as a thief.</p>
<p>10 At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.</p>
<p>11 And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceedingly great, for they are strong, and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it?</p>
<p>12 Now, therefore, saith the Lord. Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and mourning.</p>
<p>13 And rend your hearts, and not your garments and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil.</p>
<p>14 Who knoweth but he will return, and forgive, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God?</p>
<p>15 Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,</p>
<p>16 Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bridal chamber.</p>
<p>17 Between the porch and the altar the priests, the Lord&rsquo;s ministers, shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathens should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God?</p>
<p>18 The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people.</p>
<p>19 And the Lord answered, and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</p>
<p>20 And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly.</p>
<p>21 Fear not, O land, be glad, and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things.</p>
<p>22 Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength.</p>
<p>23 And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning.</p>
<p>24 And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine, and oil.</p>
<p>25 And I will restore to you the years which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm hath eaten; my great host which I sent upon you.</p>
<p>26 And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God; who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.</p>
<p>27 And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded forever.</p>
<p>28 And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.</p>
<p>29 Moreover, upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.</p>
<p>30 And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.</p>
<p>31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come.</p>
<p>32 And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved: for in Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call.</p>
