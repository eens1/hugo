<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The word of the Lord, that came to Joel, the son of Phatuel.</p>
<p>2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land: did this ever happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</p>
<p>3 Tell ye of this to your children, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.</p>
<p>4 That which the palmerworm hath left, the locust hath eaten: and that which the locust hath left, the bruchus hath eaten: and that which the bruchus hath left, the mildew hath destroyed.</p>
<p>5 Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take delight in drinking sweet wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.</p>
<p>6 For a nation come up upon my land, strong, and without number: his teeth are like the teeth of a lion: and his cheek teeth as of a lion&rsquo;s whelp.</p>
<p>7 He hath laid my vineyard waste, and hath pilled off the bark of my fig tree: he hath stripped it bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</p>
<p>8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</p>
<p>9 Sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the Lord: the priests, the Lord&rsquo;s ministers, have mourned:</p>
<p>10 The country is destroyed, the ground hath mourned: for the corn is wasted, the wine is confounded, the oil hath languished.</p>
<p>11 The husbandmen are ashamed, the vinedressers have howled for the wheat, and for the barley, because the harvest of the field is perished.</p>
<p>12 The vineyard is confounded, and the fig tree hath languished: the pomegranate tree, and the palm tree, and the apple tree, and all the trees of the field are withered: because joy is withdrawn from the children of men.</p>
<p>13 Gird yourselves, and lament, O ye priests, howl, ye ministers of the altars: go in, lie in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: because sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your God.</p>
<p>14 Sanctify ye a fast, call an assembly, gather together the ancients, all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God: and cry ye to the Lord:</p>
<p>15 Ah, ah, ah, for the day: because the day of the Lord is at hand, and it shall come like destruction from the mighty.</p>
<p>16 Is not your food cut off before your eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p>
<p>17 The beasts have rotted in their dung, the barns are destroyed, the storehouses are broken down: because the corn is confounded.</p>
<p>18 Why did the beasts groan, why did the herds of cattle low? because there is no pasture for them: yea, and the flocks of sheep are perished.</p>
<p>19 To thee, O Lord, will I cry: because fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness: and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the country.</p>
<p>20 Yea, and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a garden bed that thirsteth after rain, for the springs of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness.</p>
