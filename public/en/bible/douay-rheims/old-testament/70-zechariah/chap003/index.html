<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord: and Satan stood on his right hand to be his adversary.</p>
<p>2 And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan: and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p>
<p>3 And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments: and he stood before the face of the angel.</p>
<p>4 Who answered, and said to them that stood before him, saying: Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said to him: Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with change of garments.</p>
<p>5 And he said: Put a clean mitre upon his head: and they put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood.</p>
<p>6 And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:</p>
<p>7 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to walk with thee.</p>
<p>8 Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, thou and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they are portending men: for behold, I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.</p>
<p>9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus: upon one stone there are seven eyes: behold I will grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>
<p>10 In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shall call his friend under the vine and under the fig tree.</p>
