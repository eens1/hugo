<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And I turned and lifted up my eyes: and I saw, and behold a volume flying.</p>
<p>2 And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I see a volume flying: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</p>
<p>3 And he said to me: This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the earth: for every thief shall be judged as is there written: and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it.</p>
<p>4 I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts: and it shall come to the house of the thief, and to the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</p>
<p>5 And the angel went forth that spoke in me, and he said to me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth forth.</p>
<p>6 And I said: What is it? And he said: This is a vessel going forth. And he said: This is their eye in all the earth.</p>
<p>7 And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.</p>
<p>8 And he said: This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</p>
<p>9 And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.</p>
<p>10 And I said to the angel that spoke in me: Whither do these carry the vessel?</p>
<p>11 And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there upon its own basis.</p>
