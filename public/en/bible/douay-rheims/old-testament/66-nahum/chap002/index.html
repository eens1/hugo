<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>1 He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep the siege: watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen thy power exceedingly.</p>
<p>2 For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their vine branches.</p>
<p>3 The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his preparation, and the drivers are stupefied.</p>
<p>4 They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning running to and fro.</p>
<p>5 He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering shall be prepared.</p>
<p>6 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down to the ground.</p>
<p>7 And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts.</p>
<p>8 And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool: but the men flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.</p>
<p>9 Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.</p>
<p>10 She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.</p>
<p>11 Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them afraid?</p>
<p>12 The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.</p>
<p>13 Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more.</p>
