<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elcesite.</p>
<p>2 The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.</p>
<p>3 The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord&rsquo;s ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
<p>4 He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus fadeth away.</p>
<p>5 The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>
<p>6 Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.</p>
<p>7 The Lord is good, and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.</p>
<p>8 But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
<p>9 What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.</p>
<p>10 For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.</p>
<p>11 Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.</p>
<p>12 Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more.</p>
<p>13 And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.</p>
<p>14 And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.</p>
<p>15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off.</p>
