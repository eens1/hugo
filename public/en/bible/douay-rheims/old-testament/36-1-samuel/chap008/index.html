<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<p>1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.</p>
<p>2 Now the name of his firstborn son was Joel: and the name of the second was Abia, judges in Bersabee.</p>
<p>3 And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
<p>4 Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled came to Samuel to Ramatha.</p>
<p>5 And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: make us a king, to judge us, as all nations have.</p>
<p>6 And the word was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, that they should say: Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the Lord.</p>
<p>7 And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
<p>8 According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day: as they have forsaken me, and served strange gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>
<p>9 Now, therefore, hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell them the right of the king, that shall reign over them.</p>
<p>10 Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people that had desired a king of him,</p>
<p>11 And said: This will be the right of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and will make them his horsemen, and his running footmen, to run before his chariots,</p>
<p>12 And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and his centurions, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.</p>
<p>13 Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments, and to be his cooks, and bakers.</p>
<p>14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best oliveyards, and give them to his servants.</p>
<p>15 Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn, and of the revenues of your vineyards, to give to his eunuchs and servants.</p>
<p>16 Your servants also, and handmaids, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, he will take away, and put them to his work.</p>
<p>17 Your flocks also he will tithe, and you shall be his servants.</p>
<p>18 And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king, whom you have chosen to yourselves: and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a king.</p>
<p>19 But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and they said, Nay: but there shall be a king over us,</p>
<p>20 And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles for us.</p>
<p>21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.</p>
<p>22 And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel: Let every man go to his city.</p>
