<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p>2 Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?</p>
<p>3 Shall wood be taken of it, to do any work, or shall a pin be made of it for any vessel to hang thereon?</p>
<p>4 Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes: shall it be useful for any work?</p>
<p>5 Even when it was whole it was not fit for work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured and consumed it, shall any work be made of it?</p>
<p>6 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>7 And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them.</p>
<p>8 And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate, because they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God.</p>
