<h1>Chapter 30</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p>2 Son of man prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Howl ye, Woe, woe to the day:</p>
<p>3 For the day is near, yea the day of the Lord is near: a cloudy day, it shall be the time of the nations.</p>
<p>4 And the sword shall come upon Egypt: and there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the rest of the crowd, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword.</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Lord God: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her empire shall be brought down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord the God of hosts.</p>
<p>7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</p>
<p>8 And they shall know that I am the Lord: when I shall have set a fire in Egypt, and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>9 In that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to destroy the confidence of Ethiopia, and there shall be dread among them in the day of Egypt: because it shall certainly come.</p>
<p>10 Thus saith the Lord God: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>11 He and his people with him, the strongest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords upon Egypt: and shall fill the land with the slain.</p>
<p>12 And I will make the channels of the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and will lay waste the land and all that is therein by the hands of strangers, I the Lord have spoken it.</p>
<p>13 Thus saith the Lord God: I will also destroy the idols, and I will make an end of the idols of Memphis: and there shall: be no more a prince of the land of Egypt and I will cause a terror in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>14 And I will destroy the land of Phatures, and will make a fire in Taphnis, and will execute judgments in Alexandria.</p>
<p>15 And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria.</p>
<p>16 And I will make a fire in Egypt: Pelusium shall be in pain like a woman in labour, and Alexandria shall be laid waste, and in Memphis there shall be daily distresses.</p>
<p>17 The young men of Heliopolis, and of Bubastus shall fall by the sword, and they themselves shall go into captivity.</p>
<p>18 And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led into captivity.</p>
<p>19 And I will execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p>20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came, me, saying:</p>
<p>21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt: and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, to be tied up with clothes, and swathed with linen, that it might recover strength, and hold the sword.</p>
<p>22 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break into pieces his strong arm, which is already broken: and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand:</p>
<p>23 And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.</p>
<p>24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharao, and they shall groan bitterly being slain before his face.</p>
<p>25 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fall: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>26 And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will scatter them through the countries, and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
