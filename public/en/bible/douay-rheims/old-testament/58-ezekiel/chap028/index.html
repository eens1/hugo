<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p>2 Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said: I am God, and I sit in the chair of God in the heart of the sea: whereas thou art a man, and not God: and hast set thy heart as if it were the heart of God.</p>
<p>3 Behold thou art wiser than Daniel: no secret is hid from thee.</p>
<p>4 In thy wisdom and thy understanding thou hast made thyself strong: and hast gotten gold an silver into thy treasures.</p>
<p>5 By the greatness of thy wisdom, and by thy traffic thou hast increased thy strength: and thy heart is lifted up with thy strength.</p>
<p>6 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Because thy heart is lifted up as the heart of God:</p>
<p>7 Therefore behold, I will bring upon thee strangers: the strongest of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy beauty.</p>
<p>8 They shall kill thee, and bring thee down: and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain in the heart of the sea.</p>
<p>9 Wilt thou yet say before them that slay thee: I am God; whereas thou art a man, and not God, in the hand of them that slay thee?</p>
<p>10 Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.</p>
<p>11 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre:</p>
<p>12 And say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.</p>
<p>13 Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God: every precious stone was thy covering: the sardius, the topaz, and the jasper, the chrysolite, and the onyx, and the beryl, the sapphire, and the carbuncle, and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty: and thy pipes were prepared in the day that thou wast created.</p>
<p>14 Thou a cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in the holy mountain of God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire.</p>
<p>15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was found in thee.</p>
<p>16 By the multitude of thy merchandise, thy inner parts were filled with iniquity, and thou hast sinned: and I cast thee out from the mountain of God, and destroyed thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst of the stones of fire.</p>
<p>17 And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I have set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee.</p>
<p>18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, and by the iniquity of thy traffic: therefore I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, to devour thee, and I will make thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee.</p>
<p>19 All that shall see thee among the nations, shall be astonished at thee: thou art brought to nothing, and thou shalt never be any more.</p>
<p>20 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p>21 Son of man, set thy face against Sidon: and thou shalt prophesy of it,</p>
<p>22 And shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall execute judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.</p>
<p>23 And I will send into her pestilence, and blood in her streets: and they shall fall being slain by the sword on all sides in the midst thereof: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p>24 And the house of Israel shall have no more a stumblingblock of bitterness, nor a thorn causing pain on every side round about them, of them that are against them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God.</p>
<p>25 Thus saith the Lord God: When I shall have gathered together the house of Israel out of the people among whom they are scattered: I will be sanctified in them before the Gentiles: and they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.</p>
<p>26 And they shall dwell therein secure, and they shall build houses, and shall plant vineyards, and shall dwell with confidence, when I shall have executed judgments upon all that are their enemies round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.</p>
