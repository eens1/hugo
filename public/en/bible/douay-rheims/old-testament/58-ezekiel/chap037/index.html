<h1>Chapter 37</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones.</p>
<p>2 And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry.</p>
<p>3 And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live and I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.</p>
<p>4 And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>5 Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.</p>
<p>6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p>7 And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one, its joint.</p>
<p>8 And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.</p>
<p>9 And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.</p>
<p>10 And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
<p>11 And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel: they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.</p>
<p>12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.</p>
<p>13 And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:</p>
<p>14 And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:</p>
<p>15 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p>16 And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.</p>
<p>17 And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.</p>
<p>18 And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?</p>
<p>19 Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.</p>
<p>20 And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.</p>
<p>21 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take of the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.</p>
<p>22 And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms.</p>
<p>23 Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
<p>24 And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.</p>
<p>25 And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children&rsquo;s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</p>
<p>26 And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.</p>
<p>27 And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>28 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.</p>
