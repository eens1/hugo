<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>1 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Moab, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath burnt the bones of the king of Edom even to ashes.</p>
<p>2 And I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the houses of Carioth: and Moab shall die with a noise, with the sound of the trumpet:</p>
<p>3 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all his princes with him, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>4 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Juda, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath cast away the law of the Lord, and hath not kept his commandments: for their idols have caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked.</p>
<p>5 And I will send a fire into Juda, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath sold the just man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>7 They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the humble: and the son and his father have gone to the same young woman, to profane my holy name.</p>
<p>8 And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar: and drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.</p>
<p>9 Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face: whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was strong as an oak: and I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots beneath.</p>
<p>10 It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years through the wilderness, that you might possess the land of the Amorrhite.</p>
<p>11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?</p>
<p>12 And you will present wine to the Nazarites: and command the prophets, saying: Prophesy not.</p>
<p>13 Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden with hay.</p>
<p>14 And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant shall not possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his life.</p>
<p>15 And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, neither shall the rider of the horse save his life.</p>
<p>16 And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in that day, saith the Lord.</p>
