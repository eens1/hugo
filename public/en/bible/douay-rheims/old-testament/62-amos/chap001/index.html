<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Thecua: which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two years before the earthquake.</p>
<p>2 And he said: The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned, and the top of Carmel is withered.</p>
<p>3 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four I will not convert it: because they have thrashed Galaad with iron wains.</p>
<p>4 And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the houses of Benadad.</p>
<p>5 And I will break the bar of Damascus: and I will cut off the inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria shall be carried away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four I will not convert it: because they have carried away a perfect captivity to shut them up in Edom.</p>
<p>7 And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</p>
<p>8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon: and I will turn my hand against Accaron, and the rest of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.</p>
<p>9 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four I will not convert it: because they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom, and have not remembered the covenant of brethren.</p>
<p>10 And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</p>
<p>11 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath pursued his brother with the sword, and hath carried on his fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.</p>
<p>12 I will send a fire into Theman: and it shall devour the houses of Bosra.</p>
<p>13 Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath ripped up the women with child of Galaad to enlarge his border.</p>
<p>14 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it shall devour the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle, and with a whirlwind in the day of trouble.</p>
<p>15 And Melchom shall go into captivity, both he, and his princes together, saith the Lord.</p>
