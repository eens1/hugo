<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<p>1 And David said: Is there any one, think you, left of the house of Saul, that I may shew kindness to him for Jonathan&rsquo;s sake?</p>
<p>2 Now there was of the house of Saul, a servant named Siba: and when the king had called him to him, he said to him: Art thou Siba? And he answered: I am Siba thy servant.</p>
<p>3 And the king said: Is there any one left of the house of Saul, that I may shew the mercy of God unto Him? And Siba said to the king: There is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his feet.</p>
<p>4 Where is he? said he. And Siba said to the king: Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodabar.</p>
<p>5 Then King David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodabar.</p>
<p>6 And when Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come to David, he fell on his face and worshipped. And David said: Miphiboseth? And he answered: Behold thy servant.</p>
<p>7 And David said to him: Fear not, for I will surely shew thee mercy for Jonathan thy father&rsquo;s sake, and I will restore the lands of Saul the father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table always.</p>
<p>8 He bowed down to him, and said: Who am I thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p>
<p>9 Then the King called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him: All that belonged to Saul, and all his house, I have given to thy master&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>10 Thou therefore and the sons and thy servants shall till the land for him: and thou shalt bring in food for thy master&rsquo;s son, that he may be maintained: and Miphiboseth the son of thy master shall always eat bread at my table. And Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p>
<p>11 And Siba said to the king: As thou my lord the hast commanded thy servant, so will thy servant do: and Miphiboseth shall eat at my table, as one of the sons of the King.</p>
<p>12 And Miphiboseth had a young son whose name was Micha: and all that kindred of the house of Siba served Miphiboseth.</p>
<p>13 But Miphiboseth dwelt in Jerusalem: because he ate always of the king&rsquo;s table: and he was lame of both feet.</p>
