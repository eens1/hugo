<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.</p>
<p>2 And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king&rsquo;s household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.</p>
<p>3 And the king said: Where is thy master&rsquo;s son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day, will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p>
<p>4 And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.</p>
<p>5 And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,</p>
<p>6 And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.</p>
<p>7 And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.</p>
<p>8 The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood.</p>
<p>9 And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.</p>
<p>10 And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?</p>
<p>11 And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him.</p>
<p>12 Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.</p>
<p>13 And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill&rsquo;s side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.</p>
<p>14 And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>
<p>15 But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.</p>
<p>16 And when Chusai the Arachite, David&rsquo;s friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.</p>
<p>17 And Absalom said to him, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>
<p>18 And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.</p>
<p>19 Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king&rsquo;s son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.</p>
<p>20 And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.</p>
<p>21 And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.</p>
<p>22 So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father&rsquo;s concubines before all Israel.</p>
<p>23 Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.</p>
