<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<p>1 Then Tobias called the angel to him, whom he took to be a man, and said to him: Brother Azarias, I pray thee hearken to my words:</p>
<p>2 If I should give myself to be thy servant I should not make a worthy return for thy care.</p>
<p>3 However, I beseech thee, to take with thee beasts and servants, and to go to Gabelus to Rages the city of the Medes: and to restore to him his note of hand, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my wedding.</p>
<p>4 For thou knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I stay one day more, his soul will be afflicted.</p>
<p>5 And indeed thou seest how Raguel hath adjured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise.</p>
<p>6 Then Raphael took four of Raguel&rsquo;s servants, and two camels, and went to Rages the city of the Medes: and finding Gabelus, gave him his note of hand, and received of him all the money.</p>
<p>7 And he told him concerning Tobias the son of Tobias, all that had been done: and made him come with him to the wedding.</p>
<p>8 And when he was come into Raguel&rsquo;s house he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaped up, and they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God,</p>
<p>9 And said: The God of Israel bless thee, because thou art the son of a very good and just man, and that feareth God, and doth almsdeeds:</p>
<p>10 And may a blessing come upon thy wife and upon your parents.</p>
<p>11 And may you see your children, and your children&rsquo;s children, unto the third and fourth generation: and may your seed be blessed by the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever.</p>
<p>12 And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but the marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the Lord.</p>
