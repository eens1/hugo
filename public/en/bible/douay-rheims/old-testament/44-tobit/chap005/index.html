<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.</p>
<p>2 But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.</p>
<p>3 Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.</p>
<p>4 But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.</p>
<p>5 Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.</p>
<p>6 And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?</p>
<p>7 But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?</p>
<p>8 And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.</p>
<p>9 And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.</p>
<p>10 Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.</p>
<p>11 So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.</p>
<p>12 And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness and see not the light of heaven?</p>
<p>13 And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.</p>
<p>14 And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.</p>
<p>15 And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.</p>
<p>16 And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?</p>
<p>17 And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?</p>
<p>18 But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.</p>
<p>19 And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.</p>
<p>20 And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.</p>
<p>21 And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.</p>
<p>22 Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.</p>
<p>23 And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.</p>
<p>24 I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.</p>
<p>25 For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.</p>
<p>26 And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.</p>
<p>27 For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.</p>
<p>28 At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</p>
