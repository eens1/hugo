<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with joy.</p>
<p>2 And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to Anna his wife: How like is this young man to my cousin?</p>
<p>3 And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?</p>
<p>4 But they said: We are of the tribe of Nephtali, of the captivity of Ninive.</p>
<p>5 And Raguel said to them: Do you know Tobias my brother? And they said: We know him.</p>
<p>6 And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young man&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>7 And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.</p>
<p>8 And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.</p>
<p>9 And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,</p>
<p>10 Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.</p>
<p>11 Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her: and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,</p>
<p>12 The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.</p>
<p>13 Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.</p>
<p>14 And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.</p>
<p>15 And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his blessing in you.</p>
<p>16 And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.</p>
<p>17 And afterwards they made merry, blessing God.</p>
<p>18 And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and bade her to prepare another chamber.</p>
<p>19 And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.</p>
<p>20 And she said to her: Be of good cheer, my daughter: the Lord of heaven give thee joy for the trouble thou hast undergone.</p>
