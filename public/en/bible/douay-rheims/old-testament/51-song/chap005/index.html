<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.</p>
<p>2 I sleep, and my heart watcheth: the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights.</p>
<p>3 I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</p>
<p>4 My beloved put his hand through the key hole, and my bowels were moved at his touch.</p>
<p>5 I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh.</p>
<p>6 I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me.</p>
<p>7 The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</p>
<p>8 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.</p>
<p>9 What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us?</p>
<p>10 My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.</p>
<p>11 His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven.</p>
<p>12 His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams.</p>
<p>13 His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies dropping choice myrrh.</p>
<p>14 His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sapphires.</p>
<p>15 His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, excellent as the cedars.</p>
<p>16 His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>17 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou most beautiful among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with thee?</p>
