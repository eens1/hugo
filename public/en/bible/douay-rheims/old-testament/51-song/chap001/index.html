<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>1 Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine,</p>
<p>2 Smelling sweet of the best ointments. Thy name is as oil poured out: therefore young maidens have loved thee.</p>
<p>3 Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine: the rightous love thee.</p>
<p>4 I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p>5 Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.</p>
<p>6 Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.</p>
<p>7 If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.</p>
<p>8 To my company of horsemen, in Pharao&rsquo;s chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.</p>
<p>9 Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove&rsquo;s, thy neck as jewels.</p>
<p>10 We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.</p>
<p>11 While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.</p>
<p>12 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.</p>
<p>13 A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.</p>
<p>14 Behold thou are fair, O my love, behold thou are fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.</p>
<p>15 Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.</p>
<p>16 The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.</p>
