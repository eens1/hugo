<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>51 And they threw down their arms, and made peace, and the Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm, and were renowned throughout the kingdom, and returned to Jerusalem with many spoils.</p>
<p>52 So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom: and the land was quiet before him.</p>
<p>53 And he falsified all whatsoever he had said, and alienated himself from Jonathan, and did not reward him according to the benefits he had received from him, but gave him great trouble.</p>
<p>54 And after this Tryphon returned, and with him Antiochus, the young boy, who was made king, and put on the diadem.</p>
<p>55 And there assembled unto him all the hands which Demetrius had sent away, and they fought against Demetrius who turned his back and fled.</p>
<p>56 And Tryphon took the elephants, and made himself master of Antioch.</p>
<p>57 And young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying: I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities, and to be one of the king&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>58 And he sent him vessels of gold for his service, and he gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle:</p>
<p>59 And he made his brother, Simon, governor, from the borders of Tyre even to the confines of Egypt.</p>
<p>60 Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the river, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to help him, and he came to Ascalon, and they met him honourably out of the city.</p>
<p>61 And he went from thence to Gaza: and they that were in Gaza shut him out: and he besieged it, and burnt all the suburbs round about, and took the spoils.</p>
<p>62 And the men of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan, and he gave them the right hand: and he took their sons for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem: and he went through the country, as far as Damascus.</p>
<p>63 And Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come treacherously to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great army, purposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom.</p>
<p>64 And he went against them: but left his brother, Simon, in the country.</p>
<p>65 And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and assaulted it many days, and shut them up.</p>
<p>66 And they desired him to make peace, and he granted it them: and he cast them out from thence, and took the city, and placed a garrison in it.</p>
<p>67 And Jonathan and his army encamped by the water of Genesar, and before it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor.</p>
<p>68 And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains: but he went out against them.</p>
<p>69 And they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle.</p>
<p>70 And all that were on Jonathan&rsquo;s side fled, and none was left of them, but Mathathias, the son of Absalom, and Judas, the son of Calphi, chief captain of the army.</p>
<p>71 And Jonathan rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.</p>
<p>72 And Jonathan turned again to them to battle, and he put them to flight, and they fought.</p>
<p>73 And they of his part that fled saw this, and they turned again to him, and they all with him pursued the enemies, even to Cades, to their own camp, and they came even thither.</p>
<p>74 And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand men: and Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.</p>
