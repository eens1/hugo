      <description>1 And it came to pass, when she had ceased to cry to the Lord, that she rose from the place wherein she lay prostrate before the Lord.&#xA;2 And she called her maid, and going down into her house she took off her haircloth, and put away the garments of her widowhood,&#xA;3 And she washed her body, and anointed herself with the best ointment, and plaited the hair of her head, and put a bonnet upon her head, and clothed herself with the garments of her gladness, and put sandals on her feet, and took her bracelets, and lilies, and earlets, and rings, and adorned herself with all her ornaments.</description>

      <description>1 Then Holofernes said to her: Be of good comfort, and fear not in thy heart: for I have never hurt a man that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor the king.&#xA;2 And if thy people had not despised me, I would never have lifted up my spear against them.&#xA;3 But now tell me, for what cause hast thou left them, and why it hath pleased thee to come to us?</description>

      <description>1 Then he ordered that she should go in where his treasures were laid up, and bade her tarry there, and he appointed what should be given her from his own table.&#xA;2 And Judith answered him and said: Now I cannot eat of these things which thou commandest to be given me, lest sin come upon me: but I will eat of the things which I have brought.&#xA;3 And Holofernes said to her: If these things which thou hast brought with thee fail thee, what shall we do for thee?</description>

      <description>1 And Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls.&#xA;2 And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every man take his arms, and rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.&#xA;3 Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle.&#xA;4 And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them.</description>

      <description>1 And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, courage and counsel fled from them, and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight.&#xA;2 So that no one spoke to his neighbour, but hanging down the head, leaving all things behind, they made haste to escape from the Hebrews, who, as they heard, were coming armed upon them, and fled by the ways of the fields, and the paths of the hills.</description>

      <description>1 Then Judith sung this canticle to the Lord, saying:&#xA;2 Begin ye to the Lord with timbrels, sing ye to the Lord with cymbals, tune unto him a new psalm, extol and call upon his name.&#xA;3 The Lord putteth an end to wars, the Lord is his name.&#xA;4 He hath set his camp in the midst of his people, to deliver us from the hand of all our enemies.</description>

      <description>1 In the thirteenth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, the two and twentieth day of the first month, the word was given out in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, that he would revenge himself.&#xA;2 And he called all the ancients, and all the governors, and his officers of war, and communicated to them the secret of his counsel:&#xA;3 And he said that his thoughts were to bring all the earth under his empire.</description>

      <description>1 Then the kings and the princes of all the cities and provinces, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Syria Sobal, and Libya, and Cilicia sent their ambassadors, who coming to Holofernes, said:&#xA;2 Let thy indignation towards us cease, for it is better for us to live and serve Nabuchodonosor the great king, and be subject to thee, than to die and to perish, or suffer the miseries of slavery.&#xA;3 All our cities and our possessions, all mountains and hills, and fields, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our goods, and families are in thy sight:</description>

      <description>1 Then the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Juda, hearing these things, were exceedingly afraid of him.&#xA;2 Dread and horror seized upon their minds, lest he should do the same to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord, that he had done to other cities and their temples.&#xA;3 And they sent into all Samaria round about, as far as Jericho, and seized upon all the tops of the mountains:</description>

      <description>1 And it was told Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians, that the children of Israel prepared themselves to resist, and had shut up the ways of the mountains.&#xA;2 And he was transported with exceeding great fury and indignation, and he called all the princes of Moab and the leaders of Ammon.&#xA;3 And he said to them: Tell me what is this people that besetteth the mountains: or what are their cities, and of what sort, and how great: also what is their power, or what is their multitude: or who is the king over their warfare:</description>

      <description>1 And it came to pass when they had left off speaking, that Holofernes being in a violent passion, said to Achior:&#xA;2 Because thou hast prophesied unto us, saying: That the nation of Israel is defended by their God, to shew thee that there is no God, but Nabuchodonosor:&#xA;3 When we shall slay them all as one man, then thou also shalt die with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel shall perish with thee:</description>

      <description>1 But Holofernes on the next day gave orders to his army, to go up against Bethulia.&#xA;2 Now there were in his troops a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two and twenty thousand horsemen, besides the preparations of those men who had been taken, and who had been brought away out of the provinces and cities of all the youth.&#xA;3 All these prepared themselves together to fight against the children of Israel, and they came by the hillside to the top, which looketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, unto Chelmon, which is over against Esdrelon.</description>

      <description>1 And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory: and putting on haircloth, laid ashes on her head: and falling down prostrate before the Lord, she cried to the Lord, saying:&#xA;2 Lord God of my father Simeon, who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, and uncovered the virgin unto confusion:&#xA;3 And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters into captivity: and all their spoils to be divided to the servants, who were zealous with thy zeal: assist, I beseech thee, O Lord God, me a widow.</description>
