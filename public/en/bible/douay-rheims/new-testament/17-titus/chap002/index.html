<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>1 But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:</p>
<p>2 That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</p>
<p>3 The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</p>
<p>4 That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children.</p>
<p>5 To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands: that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p>6 Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.</p>
<p>7 In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,</p>
<p>8 The sound word that can not be blamed: that he who is on the contrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</p>
<p>9 Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters: in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:</p>
<p>10 Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p>11 For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:</p>
<p>12 Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world,</p>
<p>13 Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.</p>
<p>15 These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
