<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.</p>
<p>2 To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.</p>
<p>3 For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.</p>
<p>4 But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:</p>
<p>5 Not by the works of justice which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>6 Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:</p>
<p>7 That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to hope of life everlasting.</p>
<p>8 It is a faithful saying. And these things I will have thee affirm constantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p>9 But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p>10 A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:</p>
<p>11 Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</p>
<p>12 When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.</p>
<p>13 Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing be wanting to them.</p>
<p>14 And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p>15 All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</p>
