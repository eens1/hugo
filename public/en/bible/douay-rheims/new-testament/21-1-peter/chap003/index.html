<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,</p>
<p>2 Considering your chaste conversation with fear.</p>
<p>3 Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</p>
<p>4 But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.</p>
<p>5 For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</p>
<p>6 As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well and not fearing any disturbance.</p>
<p>7 Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p>8 And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:</p>
<p>9 Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.</p>
<p>10 For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</p>
<p>11 Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace and pursue it:</p>
<p>12 Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.</p>
<p>13 And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?</p>
<p>14 But if also you suffer any thing for justice&rsquo; sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.</p>
<p>15 But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</p>
<p>16 But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p>17 For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer than doing ill.</p>
<p>18 Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</p>
<p>19 In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:</p>
<p>20 Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</p>
<p>21 Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>22 Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</p>
