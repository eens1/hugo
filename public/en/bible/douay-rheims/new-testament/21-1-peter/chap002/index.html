<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations and envies and all detractions,</p>
<p>2 As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:</p>
<p>3 If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</p>
<p>4 Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen and made honourable by God:</p>
<p>5 Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>6 Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p>7 To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</p>
<p>8 And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</p>
<p>9 But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</p>
<p>10 Who in times past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy: but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p>11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,</p>
<p>12 Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p>13 Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God&rsquo;s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling,</p>
<p>14 Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of the good.</p>
<p>15 For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p>16 As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p>17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p>18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward.</p>
<p>19 For this is thankworthy: if, for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p>20 For what glory is it, if, committing sin and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently: this is thankworthy before God.</p>
<p>21 For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</p>
<p>22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</p>
<p>23 Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not, but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</p>
<p>24 Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.</p>
<p>25 For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</p>
