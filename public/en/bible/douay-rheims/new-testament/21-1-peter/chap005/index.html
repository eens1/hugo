<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:</p>
<p>2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake but voluntarily:</p>
<p>3 Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.</p>
<p>4 And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.</p>
<p>5 In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.</p>
<p>6 Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:</p>
<p>7 Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.</p>
<p>8 Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.</p>
<p>9 Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls, your brethren who are in the world.</p>
<p>10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you and confirm you and establish you.</p>
<p>11 To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>12 By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.</p>
<p>13 The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you. And so doth my son, Mark.</p>
<p>14 Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
