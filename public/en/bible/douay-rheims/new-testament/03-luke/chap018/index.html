<h1>Chapter 18</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray and not to faint,</p>
<p>2 Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God nor regarded man.</p>
<p>3 And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.</p>
<p>4 And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,</p>
<p>5 Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</p>
<p>6 And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>
<p>7 And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?</p>
<p>8 I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?</p>
<p>9 And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others, he spoke also this parable:</p>
<p>10 Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.</p>
<p>11 The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</p>
<p>12 I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>
<p>13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
<p>14 I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p>15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</p>
<p>16 But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>17 Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.</p>
<p>18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?</p>
<p>19 And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.</p>
<p>20 Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.</p>
<p>21 Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.</p>
<p>22 Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee. Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.</p>
<p>23 He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.</p>
<p>24 And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God</p>
<p>25 For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>26 And they that heard it said: Who then can be saved?</p>
<p>27 He said to them: The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</p>
<p>28 Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.</p>
<p>29 Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left home or parents or brethren or wife or children, for the kingdom of God&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>30 Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>
<p>31 Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.</p>
<p>32 For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.</p>
<p>33 And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p>34 And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them: and they understood not the things that were said.</p>
<p>35 Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.</p>
<p>36 And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</p>
<p>37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</p>
<p>38 And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p>39 And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p>40 And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,</p>
<p>41 Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.</p>
<p>42 And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>
<p>43 And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</p>
