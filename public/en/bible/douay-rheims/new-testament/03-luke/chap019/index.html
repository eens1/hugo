<h1>Chapter 19</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And entering he walked through Jericho.</p>
<p>2 And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans: and he was rich.</p>
<p>3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.</p>
<p>4 And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him: for he was to pass that way.</p>
<p>5 And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down: for this day I must abide in thy house.</p>
<p>6 And he made haste and came down and received him with joy.</p>
<p>7 And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.</p>
<p>8 But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.</p>
<p>9 Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</p>
<p>10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
<p>11 As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.</p>
<p>12 He said therefore: a certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</p>
<p>13 And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds and said to them: Trade till I come.</p>
<p>14 But his citizens hated him and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>
<p>15 And it came to pass that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading,</p>
<p>16 And the first came saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
<p>17 And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.</p>
<p>18 And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>
<p>19 And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.</p>
<p>20 And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.</p>
<p>21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down: and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.</p>
<p>22 He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down and reaping that which I did not sow.</p>
<p>23 And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have exacted it with usury?</p>
<p>24 And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
<p>25 And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.</p>
<p>26 But I say to you that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.</p>
<p>27 But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither and kill them before me.</p>
<p>28 And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
<p>30 Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him and bring him hither.</p>
<p>31 And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? You shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.</p>
<p>32 And they that were sent went their way and found the colt standing, as he said unto them.</p>
<p>33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?</p>
<p>34 But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>
<p>35 And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.</p>
<p>36 And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.</p>
<p>37 And when he was now coming near the descent of Mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,</p>
<p>38 Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory on high!</p>
<p>39 And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
<p>40 To whom he said: I say to you that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</p>
<p>41 And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:</p>
<p>42 If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace: but now they are hidden from thy eyes.</p>
<p>43 For the days shall come upon thee: and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and straiten thee on every side,</p>
<p>44 And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee. And they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.</p>
<p>45 And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought.</p>
<p>46 Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p>47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him.</p>
<p>48 And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>
