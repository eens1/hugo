<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.</p>
<p>2 And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.</p>
<p>3 And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.</p>
<p>4 And he went and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.</p>
<p>5 And they were glad and covenanted to give him money.</p>
<p>6 And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.</p>
<p>7 And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.</p>
<p>8 And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.</p>
<p>9 But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
<p>10 And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
<p>11 And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee: Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</p>
<p>12 And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished. And there prepare.</p>
<p>13 And they going, found as he had said to them and made ready the pasch.</p>
<p>14 And when the hour was come, he sat down: and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
<p>15 And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.</p>
<p>16 For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>17 And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks and said: Take and divide it among you.</p>
<p>18 For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.</p>
<p>19 And taking bread, he gave thanks and brake and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.</p>
<p>20 In like manner, the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.</p>
<p>21 But yet behold: the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p>
<p>22 And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.</p>
<p>23 And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
<p>24 And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.</p>
<p>25 And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them are called beneficent.</p>
<p>26 But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger: and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.</p>
<p>27 For which is greater, he that sitteth at table or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth.</p>
<p>28 And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:</p>
<p>29 And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;</p>
<p>30 That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>31 And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</p>
<p>32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.</p>
<p>33 Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.</p>
<p>34 And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:</p>
<p>35 When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything?</p>
<p>36 But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and he that hath not, let him sell his coat and buy a sword.</p>
<p>37 For I say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me. And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.</p>
<p>38 But they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them: It is enough.</p>
<p>39 And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.</p>
<p>40 And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
<p>41 And he was withdrawn away from them a stone&rsquo;s cast. And kneeling down, he prayed.</p>
<p>42 Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.</p>
<p>43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.</p>
<p>44 And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.</p>
<p>45 And when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.</p>
<p>46 And he said to them: Why sleep you? Arise: pray: lest you enter into temptation.</p>
<p>47 As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.</p>
<p>48 And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p>49 And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</p>
<p>50 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</p>
<p>51 But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.</p>
<p>52 And Jesus said to the chief priests and magistrates of the temple and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?</p>
<p>53 When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</p>
<p>54 And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter followed afar off.</p>
<p>55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.</p>
<p>56 Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.</p>
<p>57 But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.</p>
<p>58 And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.</p>
<p>59 And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him: for he is also a Galilean.</p>
<p>60 And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.</p>
<p>61 And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny thrice.</p>
<p>62 And Peter going out, wept bitterly.</p>
<p>63 And the men that held him mocked him and struck him.</p>
<p>64 And they blindfolded him and smote his face. And they asked him saying: Prophesy: Who is it that struck thee?</p>
<p>65 And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.</p>
<p>66 And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people and the chief priests and scribes came together. And they brought him into their council saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.</p>
<p>67 And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.</p>
<p>68 And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
<p>69 But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p>70 Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.</p>
<p>71 And they said: What need we any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</p>
