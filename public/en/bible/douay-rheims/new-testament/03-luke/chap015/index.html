<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.</p>
<p>2 And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.</p>
<p>3 And he spoke to them this parable, saying:</p>
<p>4 What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after that which was lost, until he find it?</p>
<p>5 And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?</p>
<p>6 And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?</p>
<p>7 I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.</p>
<p>8 Or what woman having ten groats, if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it?</p>
<p>9 And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.</p>
<p>10 So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.</p>
<p>11 And he said: A certain man had two sons.</p>
<p>12 And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.</p>
<p>13 And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.</p>
<p>14 And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country: and he began to be in want.</p>
<p>15 And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.</p>
<p>16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>
<p>17 And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father&rsquo;s house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!</p>
<p>18 I will arise and will go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.</p>
<p>19 I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p>
<p>20 And rising up, he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to him fell upon his neck and kissed him.</p>
<p>21 And the son said to him: Father: I have sinned against heaven and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</p>
<p>22 And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe and put it on him: and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.</p>
<p>23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat and make merry:</p>
<p>24 Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
<p>25 Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</p>
<p>26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>
<p>27 And he said to him: Thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</p>
<p>28 And he was angry and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.</p>
<p>29 And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.</p>
<p>30 But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
<p>31 But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me; and all I have is thine.</p>
<p>32 But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.</p>
