<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And there were present, at that very time, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</p>
<p>2 And he answering, said to them: Think you that these Galileans were sinners above all the men of Galilee, because they suffered such things?</p>
<p>3 No, I say to you: but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish.</p>
<p>4 Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe and slew them: think you that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>5 No, I say to you: but except you do penance, you shall all likewise perish.</p>
<p>6 He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard: and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</p>
<p>7 And he said to the dresser of the vineyard: Behold, for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down therefore. Why cumbereth it the ground?</p>
<p>8 But he answering, said to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig about it and dung it.</p>
<p>9 And if happily it bear fruit: but if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</p>
<p>10 And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath.</p>
<p>11 And behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. And she was bowed together: neither could she look upwards at all.</p>
<p>12 Whom when Jesus saw, he called her unto him and said to her: Woman, thou art delivered from thy infirmity.</p>
<p>13 And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight and glorified God.</p>
<p>14 And the ruler of the synagogue being angry that Jesus had healed on the sabbath answering, said to the multitude: Six days there are wherein you ought to work. In them therefore come and be healed: and not on the sabbath day.</p>
<p>15 And the Lord answering him, said: Ye hypocrites, doth not every one of you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead them to water?</p>
<p>16 And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</p>
<p>17 And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done by him.</p>
<p>18 He said therefore: To what is the kingdom of God like, and whereunto shall I resemble it?</p>
<p>19 It is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden: and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof.</p>
<p>20 And again he said: Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God to be like?</p>
<p>21 It is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p>22 And he went through the cities and towns teaching and making his journey to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>23 And a certain man said to him: Lord, are they few that are saved? But he said to them:</p>
<p>24 Strive to enter by the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter and shall not be able.</p>
<p>25 But when the master of the house shall be gone in and shall shut the door, you shall begin to stand without; and knock at the door, saying: Lord, open to us. And he answering, shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are.</p>
<p>26 Then you shall begin to say: We have eaten and drunk in thy presence: and thou hast taught in our streets.</p>
<p>27 And he shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God: and you yourselves thrust out.</p>
<p>29 And there shall come from the east and the west and the north and the south: and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>30 And behold, they are last that shall be first: and they are first that shall be last.</p>
<p>31 The same day, there came some of the Pharisees, saying to him: Depart, and get thee hence, for Herod hath a mind to kill thee.</p>
<p>32 And he said to them: Go and tell that fox: Behold, I cast out devils and do cures, to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am consummated.</p>
<p>33 Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow and the day following, because it cannot be that a prophet perish, out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets; and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not?</p>
<p>35 Behold your house shall be left to you desolate. And I say to you that you shall not see me till the time come when you shall say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
