<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,</p>
<p>2 And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.</p>
<p>3 Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>4 I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</p>
<p>5 Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and towards all the saints:</p>
<p>6 That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>7 For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p>8 Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to command thee that which is to the purpose:</p>
<p>9 For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>10 I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</p>
<p>11 Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is profitable both to me and thee:</p>
<p>12 Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</p>
<p>13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel.</p>
<p>14 But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</p>
<p>15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</p>
<p>16 Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me. But how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?</p>
<p>17 If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p>18 And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</p>
<p>19 I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also.</p>
<p>20 Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord! Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p>21 Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p>22 But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p>23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.</p>
<p>25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
