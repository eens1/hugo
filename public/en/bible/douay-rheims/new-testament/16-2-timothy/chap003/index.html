<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>1 Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.</p>
<p>2 Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,</p>
<p>3 Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,</p>
<p>4 Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure more than of God:</p>
<p>5 Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.</p>
<p>6 For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:</p>
<p>7 Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>8 Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p>9 But they shall proceed no farther: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p>10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>
<p>11 Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p>12 And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p>13 But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error,</p>
<p>14 But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and which have been committed to thee. Knowing of whom thou hast learned them:</p>
<p>15 And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>16 All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice:</p>
<p>17 That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</p>
