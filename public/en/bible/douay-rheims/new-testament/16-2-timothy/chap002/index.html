<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>2 And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.</p>
<p>3 Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>4 No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.</p>
<p>5 For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p>6 The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.</p>
<p>7 Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.</p>
<p>8 Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</p>
<p>9 Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer. But the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p>10 Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</p>
<p>11 A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.</p>
<p>12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</p>
<p>13 If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p>14 Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words: for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p>15 Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</p>
<p>16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.</p>
<p>17 And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:</p>
<p>18 Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</p>
<p>19 But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.</p>
<p>21 If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p>22 But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p>23 And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.</p>
<p>24 But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p>25 With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;</p>
<p>26 And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by whom they are held captive at his will.</p>
