<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>
<p>2 And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p>3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle.</p>
<p>4 And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.</p>
<p>5 And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.</p>
<p>6 But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?</p>
<p>7 They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go ye also into my vineyard.</p>
<p>8 And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.</p>
<p>9 When therefore they were come that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>
<p>10 But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: And they also received every man a penny.</p>
<p>11 And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</p>
<p>12 Saying: These last have worked but one hour. and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.</p>
<p>13 But he answering said to one of them: friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?</p>
<p>14 Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.</p>
<p>15 Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? Is thy eye evil, because I am good?</p>
<p>16 So shall the last be first and the first last. For many are called but few chosen.</p>
<p>17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart and said to them:</p>
<p>18 Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes: and they shall condemn him to death.</p>
<p>19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p>20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.</p>
<p>21 Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.</p>
<p>22 And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.</p>
<p>23 He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.</p>
<p>24 And the ten, hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</p>
<p>25 But Jesus called them to him and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and that they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.</p>
<p>26 It shall not be so among you: but whosoever is the greater among you, let him be your minister.</p>
<p>27 And he that will be first among you shall be your servant.</p>
<p>28 Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a redemption for many.</p>
<p>29 And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</p>
<p>30 And behold two blind men sitting by the way side heard that Jesus passed by. And they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>31 And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>32 And Jesus stood and called them and said: What will ye that I do to you?</p>
<p>33 They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.</p>
<p>34 And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw and followed him.</p>
