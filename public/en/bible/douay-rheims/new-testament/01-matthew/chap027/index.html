<h1>Chapter 27</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.</p>
<p>2 And they brought him bound and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p>3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,</p>
<p>4 Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? Look thou to it.</p>
<p>5 And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed and went and hanged himself with an halter.</p>
<p>6 But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.</p>
<p>7 And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter&rsquo;s field, to be a burying place for strangers.</p>
<p>8 For this cause that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day.</p>
<p>9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>10 And they gave them unto the potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord appointed to me.</p>
<p>11 And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>12 And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.</p>
<p>13 Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?</p>
<p>14 And he answered him to never a word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</p>
<p>15 Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.</p>
<p>16 And he had then a notorious prisoner that was called Barabbas.</p>
<p>17 They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to You: Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?</p>
<p>18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
<p>19 And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
<p>20 But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas and make Jesus away.</p>
<p>21 And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said: Barabbas.</p>
<p>22 Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>23 The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>24 And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. Look you to it.</p>
<p>25 And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.</p>
<p>26 Then he released to them Barabbas: and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.</p>
<p>27 Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band.</p>
<p>28 And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</p>
<p>29 And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews.</p>
<p>30 And spitting upon him, they took the reed and struck his head.</p>
<p>31 And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p>32 And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.</p>
<p>33 And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.</p>
<p>34 And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</p>
<p>35 And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</p>
<p>36 And they sat and watched him.</p>
<p>37 And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>38 Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand and one on the left.</p>
<p>39 And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</p>
<p>40 And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
<p>41 In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said:</p>
<p>42 He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross: and we will believe him.</p>
<p>43 He trusted in God: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the Son of God.</p>
<p>44 And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.</p>
<p>45 Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>46 And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? That is, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p>47 And some that stood there and heard said: This man calleth Elias.</p>
<p>48 And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.</p>
<p>49 And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.</p>
<p>50 And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
<p>51 And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom: and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent.</p>
<p>52 And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,</p>
<p>53 And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city and appeared to many.</p>
<p>54 Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.</p>
<p>55 And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
<p>56 Among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<p>57 And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</p>
<p>58 He went to Pilate and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.</p>
<p>59 And Joseph taking the body wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth:</p>
<p>60 And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument and went his way.</p>
<p>61 And there was there Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>
<p>62 And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</p>
<p>63 Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.</p>
<p>64 Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away and say to the people: He is risen from the dead. And the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
<p>65 Pilate saith to them: You have a guard. Go, guard it as you know.</p>
<p>66 And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting guards.</p>
