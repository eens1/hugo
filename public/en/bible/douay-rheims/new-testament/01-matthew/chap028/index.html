<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p>2 And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it.</p>
<p>3 And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow.</p>
<p>4 And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men.</p>
<p>5 And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</p>
<p>6 He is not here. For he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.</p>
<p>7 And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen. And behold he will go before you into Galilee. There you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.</p>
<p>8 And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.</p>
<p>9 And behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet and adored him.</p>
<p>10 Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee. There they shall see me.</p>
<p>11 Who when they were departed, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all things that had been done.</p>
<p>12 And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,</p>
<p>13 Saying: Say you, His disciples came by night and stole him away when we were asleep.</p>
<p>14 And if the governor shall hear of this, we will persuade him and secure you.</p>
<p>15 So they taking the money, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.</p>
<p>16 And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p>17 And seeing him they adored: but some doubted.</p>
<p>18 And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p>19 Going therefore, teach ye all nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.</p>
