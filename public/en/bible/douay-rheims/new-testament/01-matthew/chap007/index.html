<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Judge not, that you may not be judged.</p>
<p>2 For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>3 And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother&rsquo;s eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</p>
<p>4 Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</p>
<p>5 Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>6 Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.</p>
<p>7 Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</p>
<p>8 For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</p>
<p>9 Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?</p>
<p>10 Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?</p>
<p>11 If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</p>
<p>12 All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</p>
<p>13 Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</p>
<p>14 How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</p>
<p>15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>
<p>16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</p>
<p>17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>
<p>18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.</p>
<p>19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</p>
<p>20 Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</p>
<p>21 Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>22 Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?</p>
<p>23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</p>
<p>24 Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,</p>
<p>25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</p>
<p>26 And every one that heareth these my words and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,</p>
<p>27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</p>
<p>28 And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</p>
<p>29 For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.</p>
