<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:</p>
<p>2 And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.</p>
<p>3 And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.</p>
<p>4 And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p>5 And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</p>
<p>6 And the disciples hearing fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.</p>
<p>7 And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them: Arise, and fear not.</p>
<p>8 And they lifting up their eyes, saw no one, but only Jesus.</p>
<p>9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</p>
<p>10 And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?</p>
<p>11 But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.</p>
<p>12 But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, But have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.</p>
<p>13 Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.</p>
<p>14 And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.</p>
<p>15 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</p>
<p>16 Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</p>
<p>17 And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</p>
<p>18 Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?</p>
<p>19 Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible to you.</p>
<p>20 But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p>21 And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</p>
<p>22 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.</p>
<p>23 And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that received the didrachmas, came to Peter, and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachma?</p>
<p>24 He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom, of their own children, or of strangers?</p>
<p>25 And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.</p>
<p>26 But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened it&rsquo;s mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.</p>
