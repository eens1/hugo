<h1>Chapter 22</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:</p>
<p>2 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who made a marriage for his son.</p>
<p>3 And he sent his servants to call them that were invited to the marriage: and they would not come.</p>
<p>4 Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come ye to the marriage.</p>
<p>5 But they neglected and went their ways, one to his farm and another to his merchandise.</p>
<p>6 And the rest laid hands on his servants and, having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.</p>
<p>7 But when the king had heard of it, he was angry: and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.</p>
<p>8 Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.</p>
<p>9 Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.</p>
<p>10 And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.</p>
<p>11 And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.</p>
<p>12 And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having on a wedding garment? But he was silent.</p>
<p>13 Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>14 For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p>15 Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.</p>
<p>16 And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker and teachest the way of God in truth. Neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.</p>
<p>17 Tell us therefore what dost thou think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>
<p>18 But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?</p>
<p>19 Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.</p>
<p>20 And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?</p>
<p>21 They say to him: Caesar&rsquo;s. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s; and to God, the things that are God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>22 And hearing this, they wondered and, leaving him, went their ways.</p>
<p>23 That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him,</p>
<p>24 Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up issue to his brother.</p>
<p>25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.</p>
<p>26 In like manner the second and the third and so on, to the seventh.</p>
<p>27 And last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p>28 At the resurrection therefore, whose wife of the seven shall she be? For they all had her.</p>
<p>29 And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</p>
<p>30 For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married, but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.</p>
<p>31 And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:</p>
<p>32 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.</p>
<p>33 And the multitudes hearing it were in admiration at his doctrine.</p>
<p>34 But the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together.</p>
<p>35 And one of them, a doctor of the law, asked him, tempting him:</p>
<p>36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>
<p>37 Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind.</p>
<p>38 This is the greatest and the first commandment.</p>
<p>39 And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p>40 On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.</p>
<p>41 And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,</p>
<p>42 Saying: What think you of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him: David&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>43 He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:</p>
<p>44 The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</p>
<p>45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
<p>46 And no man was able to answer him a word: neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>
