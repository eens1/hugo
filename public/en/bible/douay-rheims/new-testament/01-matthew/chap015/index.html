<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:</p>
<p>2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p>3 But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:</p>
<p>4 Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p>5 But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.</p>
<p>6 And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.</p>
<p>7 Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:</p>
<p>8 This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p>9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.</p>
<p>10 And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.</p>
<p>11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p>12 Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?</p>
<p>13 But he answering, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p>14 Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit.</p>
<p>15 And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.</p>
<p>16 But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?</p>
<p>17 Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?</p>
<p>18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.</p>
<p>19 For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.</p>
<p>20 These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.</p>
<p>21 And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coast of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p>22 And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously troubled by a devil.</p>
<p>23 Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:</p>
<p>24 And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep, that are lost of the house of Israel.</p>
<p>25 But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.</p>
<p>26 Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.</p>
<p>27 But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</p>
<p>28 Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.</p>
<p>29 And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee: and going up into a mountain, he sat there.</p>
<p>30 And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:</p>
<p>31 So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p>32 And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
<p>33 And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p>34 And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p>35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.</p>
<p>36 And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the people.</p>
<p>37 And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.</p>
<p>38 And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.</p>
<p>39 And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan.</p>
