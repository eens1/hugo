<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone.</p>
<p>2 And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:</p>
<p>3 That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</p>
<p>4 For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.</p>
<p>5 For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.</p>
<p>6 But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:</p>
<p>7 Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.</p>
<p>8 Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.</p>
<p>9 For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,</p>
<p>10 Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?</p>
<p>11 Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>
<p>12 And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,</p>
<p>13 To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</p>
