<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians: in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2 Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all: making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,</p>
<p>3 Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity: and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father.</p>
<p>4 Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:</p>
<p>5 For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.</p>
<p>6 And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>7 So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</p>
<p>8 For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.</p>
<p>9 For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.</p>
<p>10 And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
