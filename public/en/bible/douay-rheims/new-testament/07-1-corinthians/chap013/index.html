<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p>2 And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
<p>3 And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
<p>4 Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,</p>
<p>5 Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:</p>
<p>6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:</p>
<p>7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<p>8 Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>9 For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.</p>
<p>10 But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</p>
<p>11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.</p>
<p>12 We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.</p>
<p>13 And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.</p>
