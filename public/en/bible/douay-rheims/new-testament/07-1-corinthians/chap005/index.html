<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>2 And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.</p>
<p>3 I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,</p>
<p>4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:</p>
<p>5 To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>6 Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?</p>
<p>7 Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.</p>
<p>8 Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p>9 I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.</p>
<p>10 I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this world.</p>
<p>11 But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.</p>
<p>12 For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?</p>
<p>13 For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.</p>
