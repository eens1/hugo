      <description>1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,&#xA;2 To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours.&#xA;3 Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</description>

      <description>1 For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud: and all passed through the sea.&#xA;2 And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea:&#xA;3 And did all eat the same spiritual food:&#xA;4 And all drank the same spiritual drink: (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.)&#xA;5 But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.</description>

      <description>1 Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.&#xA;2 Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.&#xA;3 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.&#xA;4 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.</description>

      <description>1 Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.&#xA;2 You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.&#xA;3 Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.&#xA;4 Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.</description>

      <description>1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.&#xA;2 And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.&#xA;3 And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</description>

      <description>1 Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.&#xA;2 For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.&#xA;3 But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.&#xA;4 He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</description>

      <description>1 Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.&#xA;2 By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.&#xA;3 For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:</description>

      <description>1 Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints: as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.&#xA;2 On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him: that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.&#xA;3 And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.</description>

      <description>1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.&#xA;2 For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.&#xA;3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.&#xA;4 And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom.</description>

      <description>1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.&#xA;2 I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.&#xA;3 For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?</description>

      <description>1 Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.&#xA;2 Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.&#xA;3 But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man&amp;rsquo;s day. But neither do I judge my own self.&#xA;4 For I am not conscious to myself of anything.</description>

      <description>1 It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father&amp;rsquo;s wife.&#xA;2 And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.&#xA;3 I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,</description>

      <description>1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?&#xA;2 Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?&#xA;3 Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?&#xA;4 If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.</description>

      <description>1 Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.&#xA;2 But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband.&#xA;3 Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.&#xA;4 The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband.</description>

      <description>1 Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth.&#xA;2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.&#xA;3 But if any man love God, the same is known by him.&#xA;4 But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.</description>

      <description>1 Am I not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?&#xA;2 And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.&#xA;3 My defence with them that do examine me is this.&#xA;4 Have not we power to eat and to drink?</description>
