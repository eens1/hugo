<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth.</p>
<p>2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.</p>
<p>3 But if any man love God, the same is known by him.</p>
<p>4 But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.</p>
<p>5 For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many):</p>
<p>6 Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</p>
<p>7 But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</p>
<p>8 But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.</p>
<p>9 But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.</p>
<p>10 For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol&rsquo;s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?</p>
<p>11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?</p>
<p>12 Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</p>
<p>13 Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.</p>
