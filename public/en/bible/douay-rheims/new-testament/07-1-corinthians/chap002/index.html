<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.</p>
<p>2 For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.</p>
<p>3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.</p>
<p>4 And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom. but in shewing of the Spirit and power:</p>
<p>5 That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</p>
<p>6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.</p>
<p>7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:</p>
<p>8 Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
<p>9 But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
<p>10 But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>
<p>11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>12 Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.</p>
<p>13 Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
<p>14 But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</p>
<p>15 But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.</p>
<p>16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
