<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
<p>2 You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.</p>
<p>3 Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>4 Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.</p>
<p>5 And there are diversities of ministries. but the same Lord.</p>
<p>6 And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.</p>
<p>7 And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.</p>
<p>8 To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:</p>
<p>9 To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:</p>
<p>10 To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of speeches.</p>
<p>11 But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</p>
<p>12 For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.</p>
<p>13 For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.</p>
<p>14 For the body also is not one member, but many.</p>
<p>15 If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the Body?</p>
<p>16 And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<p>17 If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</p>
<p>18 But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him.</p>
<p>19 And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</p>
<p>20 But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</p>
<p>21 And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.</p>
<p>22 Yea, much, more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are more necessary</p>
<p>23 And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
<p>24 But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.</p>
<p>25 That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually careful one for another.</p>
<p>26 And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p>27 Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.</p>
<p>28 And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.</p>
<p>29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?</p>
<p>30 Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</p>
<p>31 But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.</p>
