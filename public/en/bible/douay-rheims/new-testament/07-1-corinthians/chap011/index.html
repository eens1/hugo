<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</p>
<p>2 Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.</p>
<p>3 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p>4 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.</p>
<p>5 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.</p>
<p>6 For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.</p>
<p>7 The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
<p>8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</p>
<p>9 For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.</p>
<p>10 Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.</p>
<p>11 But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
<p>12 For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.</p>
<p>13 You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?</p>
<p>14 Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
<p>15 But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.</p>
<p>16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.</p>
<p>17 Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
<p>18 For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.</p>
<p>19 For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p>20 When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper.</p>
<p>21 For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.</p>
<p>22 What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.</p>
<p>23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</p>
<p>24 And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.</p>
<p>25 In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.</p>
<p>26 For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.</p>
<p>27 Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>28 But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice.</p>
<p>29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</p>
<p>30 Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.</p>
<p>31 But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
<p>32 But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.</p>
<p>33 Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</p>
<p>34 If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.</p>
