<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:</p>
<p>2 Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.</p>
<p>3 For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.</p>
<p>4 For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.</p>
<p>5 And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</p>
<p>6 But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.</p>
<p>7 Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,</p>
<p>8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the desert,</p>
<p>9 Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,</p>
<p>10 Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.</p>
<p>11 As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p>12 Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</p>
<p>13 But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<p>14 For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</p>
<p>15 While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.</p>
<p>16 For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
<p>17 And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?</p>
<p>18 And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</p>
<p>19 And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</p>
