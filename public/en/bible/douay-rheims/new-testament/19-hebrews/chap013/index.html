<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you.</p>
<p>2 And hospitality do not forget: for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.</p>
<p>3 Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them: and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
<p>4 Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p>5 Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have. For he hath said: I will not leave thee: neither will I forsake thee.</p>
<p>6 So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.</p>
<p>7 Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,</p>
<p>8 Jesus Christ, yesterday, and today: and the same for ever.</p>
<p>9 Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats: which have not profited those that walk in them.</p>
<p>10 We have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.</p>
<p>11 For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp.</p>
<p>12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
<p>13 Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
<p>14 For, we have not here a lasting city: but we seek one that is to come.</p>
<p>15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.</p>
<p>16 And do not forget to do good and to impart: for by such sacrifices God&rsquo;s favour is obtained.</p>
<p>17 Obey your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls: that they may do this with joy and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.</p>
<p>18 Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.</p>
<p>19 And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
<p>20 And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,</p>
<p>21 Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>22 And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.</p>
<p>23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.</p>
<p>24 Salute all your prelates and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.</p>
<p>25 Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
