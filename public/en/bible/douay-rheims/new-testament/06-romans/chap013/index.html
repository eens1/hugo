<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Let every soul be subject to higher powers. For there is no power but from God: and those that are ordained of God.</p>
<p>2 Therefore, he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation.</p>
<p>3 For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</p>
<p>4 For he is God&rsquo;s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God&rsquo;s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</p>
<p>5 Wherefore be subject of necessity: not only for wrath, but also for conscience&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>6 For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</p>
<p>7 Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.</p>
<p>8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law.</p>
<p>9 For: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p>10 The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p>11 And that, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</p>
<p>12 The night is passed And the day is at hand. Let us, therefore cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.</p>
<p>13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy.</p>
<p>14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ: and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</p>
