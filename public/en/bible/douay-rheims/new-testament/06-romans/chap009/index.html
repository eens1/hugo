<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I speak the truth in Christ: I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>2 That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>
<p>3 For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren: who are my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>
<p>4 Who are Israelites: to whom belongeth the adoption as of children and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises:</p>
<p>5 Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>6 Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel.</p>
<p>7 Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children: but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
<p>8 That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are the children of God: but they that are the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.</p>
<p>9 For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come. And Sara shall have a son.</p>
<p>10 And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father.</p>
<p>11 For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand):</p>
<p>12 Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p>13 As it is written: Jacob I have loved: but Esau I have hated.</p>
<p>14 What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid!</p>
<p>15 For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.</p>
<p>16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>
<p>17 For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
<p>18 Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will. And whom he will, he hardeneth.</p>
<p>19 Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? For who resisteth his will?</p>
<p>20 O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
<p>21 Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?</p>
<p>22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,</p>
<p>23 That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared unto glory?</p>
<p>24 Even us, whom also he hath called, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>25 As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy; one that hath obtained mercy.</p>
<p>26 And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them: you are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.</p>
<p>27 And Isaias cried out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.</p>
<p>28 For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
<p>29 And Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabbath had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha.</p>
<p>30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who followed not after justice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.</p>
<p>31 But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.</p>
<p>32 Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.</p>
<p>33 As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a rock of scandal. And whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.</p>
