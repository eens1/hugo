<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.</p>
<p>2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.</p>
<p>3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.</p>
<p>4 Who art thou that judgest another man&rsquo;s servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p>5 For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day. Let every man abound in his own sense.</p>
<p>6 He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God.</p>
<p>7 For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.</p>
<p>8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>9 For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p>
<p>10 But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>11 For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p>12 Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.</p>
<p>13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>14 I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
<p>15 For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
<p>16 Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</p>
<p>17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>18 For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved of men.</p>
<p>19 Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.</p>
<p>20 Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
<p>21 It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.</p>
<p>22 Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</p>
<p>23 But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</p>
