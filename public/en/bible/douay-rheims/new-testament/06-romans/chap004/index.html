<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?</p>
<p>2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</p>
<p>3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.</p>
<p>4 Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace but according to debt.</p>
<p>5 But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</p>
<p>6 As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God reputeth justice without works:</p>
<p>7 Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins are covered.</p>
<p>8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.</p>
<p>9 This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.</p>
<p>10 How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>
<p>11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which he had, being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised: that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:</p>
<p>12 And he might be the father of circumcision; not to them only that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</p>
<p>13 For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world: but through the justice of faith.</p>
<p>14 For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void: the promise is made of no effect.</p>
<p>15 For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</p>
<p>16 Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</p>
<p>17 (As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations), before God, whom he believed: who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.</p>
<p>18 Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.</p>
<p>19 And he was not weak in faith. Neither did he consider his own body, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the dead womb of Sara.</p>
<p>20 In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust: but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</p>
<p>21 Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.</p>
<p>22 And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.</p>
<p>23 Now it is not written only for him. that it was reputed to him unto justice,</p>
<p>24 But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,</p>
<p>25 Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification.</p>
