<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils,</p>
<p>2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,</p>
<p>3 Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have known the truth.</p>
<p>4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p>5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p>6 These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.</p>
<p>7 But avoid foolish and old wives fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.</p>
<p>8 For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.</p>
<p>9 A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p>10 For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.</p>
<p>11 These things command and teach:</p>
<p>12 Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</p>
<p>13 Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.</p>
<p>14 Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</p>
<p>15 Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.</p>
<p>16 Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.</p>
