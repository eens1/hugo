<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.</p>
<p>2 For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past. And your emulation hath provoked very many.</p>
<p>3 Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:</p>
<p>4 Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.</p>
<p>5 Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.</p>
<p>6 Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.</p>
<p>7 Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</p>
<p>8 And God is able to make all grace abound in you: that ye always, having all sufficiently in all things, may abound to every good work,</p>
<p>9 As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.</p>
<p>10 And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:</p>
<p>11 That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</p>
<p>12 Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord.</p>
<p>13 By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them and unto all.</p>
<p>14 And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.</p>
<p>15 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>
