<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 But I determined this with myself, to come to you again in sorrow.</p>
<p>2 For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</p>
<p>3 And I wrote this same to you: that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
<p>4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.</p>
<p>5 And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me: but in part, that I may not burden you all.</p>
<p>6 To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many.</p>
<p>7 So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
<p>8 Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your charity towards him.</p>
<p>9 For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</p>
<p>10 And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ:</p>
<p>11 That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<p>12 And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</p>
<p>13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</p>
<p>14 Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
<p>15 For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved and in them that perish.</p>
<p>16 To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?</p>
<p>17 For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God: but with sincerity: but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</p>
