<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
<p>2 For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>
<p>3 Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.</p>
<p>4 But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p>5 In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</p>
<p>6 In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</p>
<p>7 In the word of truth, in the power of God: by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left:</p>
<p>8 By honour and dishonour: by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true: as unknown and yet known:</p>
<p>9 As dying and behold we live: as chastised and not killed:</p>
<p>10 As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching many: as having nothing and possessing all things.</p>
<p>11 Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians: our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p>12 You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are straitened.</p>
<p>13 But having the same recompense (I speak as to my children): be you also enlarged.</p>
<p>14 Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?</p>
<p>15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?</p>
<p>16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God: as God saith: I will dwell in them and walk among them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>17 Wherefore: Go out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:</p>
<p>18 And I will receive you. And will be a Father to you: and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
