<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.</p>
<p>2 That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity.</p>
<p>3 For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:</p>
<p>4 With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.</p>
<p>5 And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God;</p>
<p>6 Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.</p>
<p>7 That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us: so in this grace also you may abound.</p>
<p>8 I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.</p>
<p>9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.</p>
<p>10 And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.</p>
<p>11 Now therefore perform ye it also in deed: that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.</p>
<p>12 For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath: not according to that which he hath not.</p>
<p>13 For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.</p>
<p>14 In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an equality,</p>
<p>15 As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.</p>
<p>16 And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.</p>
<p>17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.</p>
<p>18 We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.</p>
<p>19 And not that only: but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:</p>
<p>20 Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.</p>
<p>21 For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also before men.</p>
<p>22 And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much confidence in you,</p>
<p>23 Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.</p>
<p>24 Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf.</p>
