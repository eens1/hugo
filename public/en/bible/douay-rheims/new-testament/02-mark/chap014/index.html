<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 Now the feast of the pasch and of the Azymes was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him and kill him.</p>
<p>2 But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.</p>
<p>3 And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard. And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.</p>
<p>4 Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p>
<p>5 For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p>
<p>6 But Jesus said: Let her alone. Why do You molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p>7 For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.</p>
<p>8 She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.</p>
<p>9 Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p>10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.</p>
<p>11 Who hearing it were glad: and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
<p>12 Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</p>
<p>13 And he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him.</p>
<p>14 And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</p>
<p>15 And he will shew you a large dining room furnished. And there prepare ye for us.</p>
<p>16 And his disciples went their way and came into the city. And they found as he had told them: and they prepared the pasch.</p>
<p>17 And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.</p>
<p>18 And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
<p>19 But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one by one: Is it I?</p>
<p>20 Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.</p>
<p>21 And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.</p>
<p>22 And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke and gave to them and said: Take ye. This is my body.</p>
<p>23 And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.</p>
<p>24 And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.</p>
<p>25 Amen I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.</p>
<p>27 And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.</p>
<p>28 But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p>29 But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.</p>
<p>30 And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to-day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p>31 But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</p>
<p>32 And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.</p>
<p>33 And he taketh Peter and James and John with him: and he began to fear and to be heavy.</p>
<p>34 And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch.</p>
<p>35 And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground: and he prayed that, if it might be, the hour might pass from him.</p>
<p>36 And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
<p>37 And he cometh and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?</p>
<p>38 Watch ye: and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p>39 And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.</p>
<p>40 And when he returned, he found them again asleep (for their eyes were heavy): and they knew not what to answer him.</p>
<p>41 And he cometh the third time and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>42 Rise up: let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</p>
<p>43 And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.</p>
<p>44 And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he. Lay hold on him: and lead him away carefully.</p>
<p>45 And when he was come, immediately going up to him he saith: Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed him.</p>
<p>46 But they laid hands on him and held him.</p>
<p>47 And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest and cut off his ear.</p>
<p>48 And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?</p>
<p>49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching: and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>50 Then his disciples, leaving him, all fled away.</p>
<p>51 And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.</p>
<p>52 But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.</p>
<p>53 And they brought Jesus to the high priest. And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.</p>
<p>54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.</p>
<p>55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death: and found none.</p>
<p>56 For many bore false witness against him: and their evidences were not agreeing.</p>
<p>57 And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:</p>
<p>58 We heard him say, I Will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.</p>
<p>59 And their witness did not agree.</p>
<p>60 And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?</p>
<p>61 But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?</p>
<p>62 And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>63 Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?</p>
<p>64 You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
<p>65 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.</p>
<p>66 Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.</p>
<p>67 And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>68 But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.</p>
<p>69 And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.</p>
<p>70 But he denied again. And after a, while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.</p>
<p>71 But he began o curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.</p>
<p>72 And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep,</p>
