<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p>2 And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>3 And the chief priests accused him in many things.</p>
<p>4 And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.</p>
<p>5 But Jesus still answered nothing: so that Pilate wondered.</p>
<p>6 Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.</p>
<p>7 And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.</p>
<p>8 And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
<p>9 And Pilate answered them and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?</p>
<p>10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.</p>
<p>11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</p>
<p>12 And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?</p>
<p>13 But they again cried out: Crucify him.</p>
<p>14 And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.</p>
<p>15 And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas: and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p>16 And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace: and they called together the whole band.</p>
<p>17 And they clothed him with purple: and, platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.</p>
<p>18 And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.</p>
<p>19 And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.</p>
<p>20 And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him: and they led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p>21 And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.</p>
<p>22 And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.</p>
<p>23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh. But he took it not.</p>
<p>24 And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
<p>25 And it was the third hour: and they crucified him.</p>
<p>26 And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>27 And with him they crucify two thieves: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p>28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.</p>
<p>29 And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days buildest it up again:</p>
<p>30 Save thyself, coming down from the cross.</p>
<p>31 In like manner also the chief priests, mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p>32 Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.</p>
<p>33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>34 And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p>35 And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.</p>
<p>36 And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.</p>
<p>37 And Jesus, having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p>39 And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost. said: Indeed this man was the son of God.</p>
<p>40 And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and Salome,</p>
<p>41 Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>42 And when evening was now come (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath),</p>
<p>43 Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>44 But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.</p>
<p>45 And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p>46 And Joseph, buying fine linen and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p>47 And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.</p>
