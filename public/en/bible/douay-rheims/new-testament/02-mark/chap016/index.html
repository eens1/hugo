<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.</p>
<p>2 And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.</p>
<p>3 And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>
<p>4 And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.</p>
<p>5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.</p>
<p>6 Who saith to them: Be not affrighted. you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.</p>
<p>7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee. There you shall see him, as he told you.</p>
<p>8 But they going out, fled from the sepulchre: for a trembling and fear had seized them. And they said nothing to any man: for they were afraid.</p>
<p>9 But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen; out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
<p>10 She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.</p>
<p>11 And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe.</p>
<p>12 And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.</p>
<p>13 And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.</p>
<p>14 At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.</p>
<p>15 And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
<p>16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall he condemned.</p>
<p>17 And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues.</p>
<p>18 They shall take up serpents: and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay their hand upon the sick: and they shall recover.</p>
<p>19 And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>
<p>20 But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</p>
