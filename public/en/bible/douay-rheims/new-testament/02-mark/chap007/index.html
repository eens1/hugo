<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2 And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.</p>
<p>3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients.</p>
<p>4 And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.</p>
<p>5 And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?</p>
<p>6 But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p>7 And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.</p>
<p>8 For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.</p>
<p>9 And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.</p>
<p>10 For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother. And He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.</p>
<p>11 But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban (which is a gift) whatsoever is from me shall profit thee.</p>
<p>12 And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,</p>
<p>13 Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.</p>
<p>14 And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all and understand.</p>
<p>15 There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.</p>
<p>16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>17 And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.</p>
<p>18 And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? Understand you not that every thing from without entering into a man cannot defile him:</p>
<p>19 Because it entereth not into his heart but goeth into his belly and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?</p>
<p>20 But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.</p>
<p>21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
<p>22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</p>
<p>23 All these evil things come from within and defile a man.</p>
<p>24 And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it. And he could not be hid.</p>
<p>25 For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.</p>
<p>26 For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
<p>27 Who said to her: suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</p>
<p>28 But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.</p>
<p>29 And he said to her: For this saying, go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
<p>30 And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed and that the devil was gone out.</p>
<p>31 And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst the of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
<p>32 And they bring to him one deaf and dumb: and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.</p>
<p>33 And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears: and spitting, he touched his tongue.</p>
<p>34 And looking up to heaven, he groaned and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.</p>
<p>35 And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.</p>
<p>36 And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.</p>
<p>37 And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well. He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</p>
