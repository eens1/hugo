<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>2 As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.</p>
<p>3 A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight his paths.</p>
<p>4 John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.</p>
<p>5 And there went out to him all the country of Judea and all they of Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p>6 And John was clothed camel&rsquo;s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and he ate locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p>7 And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.</p>
<p>8 I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>9 And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in Jordan.</p>
<p>10 And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him.</p>
<p>11 And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</p>
<p>12 And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.</p>
<p>13 And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan. And he was with beasts: and the angels ministered to him.</p>
<p>14 And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came in Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p>15 And saying: The time is accomplished and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel:</p>
<p>16 And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen.</p>
<p>17 And Jesus said to them: Come after me; and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
<p>18 And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.</p>
<p>19 And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:</p>
<p>20 And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.</p>
<p>21 And they entered into Capharnaum: and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.</p>
<p>22 And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p>23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
<p>24 Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p>25 And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.</p>
<p>26 And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.</p>
<p>27 And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits: and they obey him.</p>
<p>28 And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.</p>
<p>29 And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p>30 And Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</p>
<p>31 And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p>32 And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.</p>
<p>33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p>34 And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases. And he cast out many devils: and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p>35 And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.</p>
<p>36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
<p>37 And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</p>
<p>38 And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</p>
<p>39 And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and casting out devils.</p>
<p>40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down, said to him: If thou wilt thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p>41 And Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.</p>
<p>42 And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him: and he was made clean.</p>
<p>43 And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.</p>
<p>44 And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</p>
<p>45 But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city. but was without in desert places. And they flocked to him from all sides.</p>
