<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And he entered again into the synagogue: and there was a man there who had a withered hand.</p>
<p>2 And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days, that they might accuse him.</p>
<p>3 And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.</p>
<p>4 And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.</p>
<p>5 And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.</p>
<p>6 And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p>7 But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,</p>
<p>8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.</p>
<p>9 And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</p>
<p>10 For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.</p>
<p>11 And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:</p>
<p>12 Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</p>
<p>13 And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.</p>
<p>14 And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.</p>
<p>15 And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.</p>
<p>16 And to Simon he gave the name Peter:</p>
<p>17 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.</p>
<p>18 And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananean:</p>
<p>19 And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p>20 And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</p>
<p>21 And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.</p>
<p>22 And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</p>
<p>23 And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?</p>
<p>24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p>
<p>25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</p>
<p>26 And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>
<p>27 No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.</p>
<p>28 Amen I say to you that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:</p>
<p>29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.</p>
<p>30 Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.</p>
<p>31 And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>
<p>32 And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>
<p>33 And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?</p>
<p>34 And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.</p>
<p>35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</p>
