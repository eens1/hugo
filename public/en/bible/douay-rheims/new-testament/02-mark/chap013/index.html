<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.</p>
<p>2 And Jesus answering, said to him: Seest thou all these great buildings? There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p>3 And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart:</p>
<p>4 Tell us, when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled?</p>
<p>5 And Jesus answering, began to say to them: Take heed lest any man deceive you.</p>
<p>6 For many shall come in my name saying, I am he: and they shall deceive many.</p>
<p>7 And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be: but the end is not yet.</p>
<p>8 For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines. These things are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
<p>9 But look to yourselves. For they shall deliver you Up to councils: and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p>10 And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached.</p>
<p>11 And when they shall lead you and deliver you up, be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye. For it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>12 And the brother shall betray his brother unto death, and the father his son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall work their death.</p>
<p>13 And you shall be hated by all men for my name&rsquo;s sake. But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved.</p>
<p>14 And when you shall see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not (he that readeth let him understand): then let them that are in Judea flee unto the mountains.</p>
<p>15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house.</p>
<p>16 And let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up his garment.</p>
<p>17 And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.</p>
<p>18 But pray ye that these things happen not in winter.</p>
<p>19 For in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now: neither shall be.</p>
<p>20 And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but, for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</p>
<p>21 And then if any man shall say to you: Lo, here is Christ. Lo, he is here: do not believe.</p>
<p>22 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets: and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.</p>
<p>23 Take you heed therefore: behold, I have foretold you all things.</p>
<p>24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light.</p>
<p>25 And the stars of heaven shall be falling down and the powers that are in heaven shall be moved.</p>
<p>26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.</p>
<p>27 And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</p>
<p>28 Now of the fig tree learn ye a parable. When the branch thereof is now tender and the leaves are come forth, you know that summer is very near.</p>
<p>29 So you also when you shall see these things come to pass, know ye that it is very nigh, even at the doors.</p>
<p>30 Amen, I say to you that this generation shall not pass until all these things be done.</p>
<p>31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass away.</p>
<p>32 But of that day or hour no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.</p>
<p>33 Take ye heed, watch and pray. For ye know not when the time is.</p>
<p>34 Even as a man who, going into a far country, left his house and gave authority to his servants over every work and commanded the porter to watch.</p>
<p>35 Watch ye therefore (for you know not when the lord of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning):</p>
<p>36 Lest coming on a sudden, he find you sleeping.</p>
<p>37 And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.</p>
