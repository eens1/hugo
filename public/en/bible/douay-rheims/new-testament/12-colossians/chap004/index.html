<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal: knowing that you also have a master in heaven.</p>
<p>2 Be instant in prayer: watching in it with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>3 Praying withal for us also, that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound):</p>
<p>4 That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</p>
<p>5 Walk with wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>
<p>6 Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt: that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</p>
<p>7 All the things that concern me, Tychicus, our dearest brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you.</p>
<p>8 What I have sent to you for this same purpose, that he may know the things that concern you and comfort your hearts:</p>
<p>9 With Onesimus, a most beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. All things that are done here, they shall make known to you.</p>
<p>10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you: and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabas, touching whom you have received commandments. If he come unto you, receive him.</p>
<p>11 And Jesus that is called Justus: who are of the circumcision. These only are my helpers, in the kingdom of God: who have been a comfort to me.</p>
<p>12 Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, who is always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.</p>
<p>13 For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you and for them that are at Laodicea and them at Hierapolis.</p>
<p>14 Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you: and Demas.</p>
<p>15 Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea: and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.</p>
<p>16 And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.</p>
<p>17 And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</p>
<p>18 The salutation of Paul with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
