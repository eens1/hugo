      <description>1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.&#xA;2 Grace be to you and peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.&#xA;3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ:&#xA;4 As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.</description>

      <description>1 And you, when you were dead in your offences and sins,&#xA;2 Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:&#xA;3 In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:</description>

      <description>1 For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles:&#xA;2 If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:&#xA;3 How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words:&#xA;4 As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,</description>

      <description>1 I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called:&#xA;2 With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity.&#xA;3 Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&#xA;4 One body and one Spirit: as you are called in one hope of your calling.&#xA;5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</description>

      <description>1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:&#xA;2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.&#xA;3 But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:&#xA;4 Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.</description>

      <description>1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is just.&#xA;2 Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:&#xA;3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.&#xA;4 And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger: but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.&#xA;5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ.</description>
