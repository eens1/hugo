<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<p>1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is just.</p>
<p>2 Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:</p>
<p>3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.</p>
<p>4 And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger: but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.</p>
<p>5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ.</p>
<p>6 Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men: but, as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</p>
<p>7 With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.</p>
<p>8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</p>
<p>9 And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings: knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven. And there is no respect of persons with him.</p>
<p>10 Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord and in the might of his power.</p>
<p>11 Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.</p>
<p>12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.</p>
<p>13 Therefore, take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day and to stand in all things perfect.</p>
<p>14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of justice:</p>
<p>15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</p>
<p>16 In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.</p>
<p>17 And take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).</p>
<p>18 By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit: and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints:</p>
<p>19 And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</p>
<p>20 For which I am an ambassador in a chain: so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.</p>
<p>21 But that you also may know the things that concern me and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:</p>
<p>22 Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose: that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.</p>
<p>23 Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.</p>
