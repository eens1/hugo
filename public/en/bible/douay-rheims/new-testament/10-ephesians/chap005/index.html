<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:</p>
<p>2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.</p>
<p>3 But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:</p>
<p>4 Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p>5 For know you this and understand: That no fornicator or unclean or covetous person (which is a serving of idols) hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>6 Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.</p>
<p>7 Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</p>
<p>8 For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.</p>
<p>9 For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth:</p>
<p>10 Proving what is well pleasing to God.</p>
<p>11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: but rather reprove them.</p>
<p>12 For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</p>
<p>13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for all that is made manifest is light.</p>
<p>14 Wherefore he saith: Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.</p>
<p>15 See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,</p>
<p>16 But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
<p>17 Wherefore, become not unwise: but understanding what is the will of God.</p>
<p>18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury: but be ye filled with the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p>19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord:</p>
<p>20 Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</p>
<p>21 Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.</p>
<p>22 Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:</p>
<p>23 Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.</p>
<p>24 Therefore as the church is subject to Christ: so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</p>
<p>25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it:</p>
<p>26 That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:</p>
<p>27 That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p>28 So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</p>
<p>29 For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</p>
<p>30 Because we are members of him, body, of his flesh and of his bones.</p>
<p>31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother: and shall cleave to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.</p>
<p>32 This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the church.</p>
<p>33 Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love for his wife as himself: And let the wife fear her husband.</p>
