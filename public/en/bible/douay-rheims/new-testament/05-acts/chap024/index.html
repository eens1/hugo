<h1>Chapter 24</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And after five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with some ancients and one Tertullus, an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.</p>
<p>2 And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas, through thee we live in much peace and many things are rectified by thy providence,</p>
<p>3 We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.</p>
<p>4 But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in a few words.</p>
<p>5 We have found this to be a pestilent man and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world: and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.</p>
<p>6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.</p>
<p>7 But Lysias the tribune, coming upon us with great violence, took him away out of our hands;</p>
<p>8 Commanding his accusers to come to thee. Of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.</p>
<p>9 And the Jews also added and said that these things were so.</p>
<p>10 Then Paul answered (the governor making a sign to him to speak): Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.</p>
<p>11 For thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>12 And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or causing any concourse of the people: neither in the synagogues, nor in the city.</p>
<p>13 Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p>14 But this I confess to thee that according to the way which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:</p>
<p>15 Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.</p>
<p>16 And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence, towards God and towards men.</p>
<p>17 Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings and vows.</p>
<p>18 In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude nor with tumult.</p>
<p>19 But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee and to accuse, if they had anything against me:</p>
<p>20 Or let these men themselves say if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,</p>
<p>21 Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.</p>
<p>22 And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.</p>
<p>23 And he commanded a centurion to keep him: and that he should be easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.</p>
<p>24 And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul and heard of him the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>25 And as he treated of justice and chastity and of the judgment to come, Felix, being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.</p>
<p>26 Hoping also withal that money should be given him by Paul: for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.</p>
<p>27 But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
