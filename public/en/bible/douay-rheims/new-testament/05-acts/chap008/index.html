<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And at that time, there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem. And they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
<p>2 And devout men took order for Stephen&rsquo;s funeral and made great mourning over him.</p>
<p>3 But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house: and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.</p>
<p>4 They therefore that were dispersed went about preaching the word of God.</p>
<p>5 And Philip, going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.</p>
<p>6 And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
<p>7 For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.</p>
<p>8 And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
<p>9 There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:</p>
<p>10 To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.</p>
<p>11 And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.</p>
<p>12 But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
<p>13 Then Simon himself believed also and, being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.</p>
<p>14 Now, when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.</p>
<p>15 Who, when they were come, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>16 For he was not as yet come upon any of them: but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>17 Then they laid their hands upon them: and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>18 And when Simon saw that, by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p>19 Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:</p>
<p>20 Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee: because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
<p>21 Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
<p>22 Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness: and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p>23 For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity.</p>
<p>24 Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</p>
<p>25 And they indeed, having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem: and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.</p>
<p>26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.</p>
<p>27 And rising up, he went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.</p>
<p>28 And he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading Isaias the prophet.</p>
<p>29 And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
<p>30 And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?</p>
<p>31 Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p>32 And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.</p>
<p>33 In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?</p>
<p>34 And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p>35 Then Philip, opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</p>
<p>36 And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is water: What doth hinder me from being baptized?</p>
<p>37 And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
<p>38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.</p>
<p>39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip: and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>40 But Philip was found in Azotus: and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
