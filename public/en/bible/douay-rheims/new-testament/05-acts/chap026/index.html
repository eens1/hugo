<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.</p>
<p>2 I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.</p>
<p>3 Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions, that are among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p>4 And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:</p>
<p>5 Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived, a Pharisee.</p>
<p>6 And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:</p>
<p>7 Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.</p>
<p>8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should raise the dead?</p>
<p>9 And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>10 Which also I did at Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.</p>
<p>11 And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.</p>
<p>12 Whereupon, when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,</p>
<p>13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that were in company with me.</p>
<p>14 And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the good.</p>
<p>15 And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</p>
<p>16 But rise up and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister and a witness of those things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,</p>
<p>17 Delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which now I send thee:</p>
<p>18 To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.</p>
<p>19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>20 But to them first that are at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.</p>
<p>21 For this cause, the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.</p>
<p>22 But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:</p>
<p>23 That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>24 As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.</p>
<p>25 And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.</p>
<p>26 For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.</p>
<p>27 Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.</p>
<p>28 And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</p>
<p>29 And Paul said: I would to God that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.</p>
<p>30 And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them.</p>
<p>31 And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.</p>
<p>32 And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</p>
