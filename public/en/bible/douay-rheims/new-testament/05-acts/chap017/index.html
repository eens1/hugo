<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</p>
<p>2 And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them. And for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:</p>
<p>3 Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.</p>
<p>4 And some of them believed and were associated to Paul and Silas: and of those that served God and of the Gentiles a great multitude: and of noble women not a few.</p>
<p>5 But the Jews, moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar: and besetting Jason&rsquo;s house, sought to bring them out unto the people.</p>
<p>6 And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar are come hither also:</p>
<p>7 Whom Jason hath received. And these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</p>
<p>8 And they stirred up the people: and the rulers of the city, hearing these things,</p>
<p>9 And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.</p>
<p>10 But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
<p>11 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.</p>
<p>12 And many indeed of them believed: and of honourable women that were Gentiles and of men, not a few.</p>
<p>13 And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.</p>
<p>14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.</p>
<p>15 And they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
<p>16 Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
<p>17 He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews and with them that served God: and in the market place, every day, with them that were there.</p>
<p>18 And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him. And some said: What is it that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods. Because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</p>
<p>19 And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?</p>
<p>20 For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
<p>21 (Now all the Athenians and strangers that were there employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)</p>
<p>22 But Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</p>
<p>23 For passing by and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the Unknown God. What therefore you worship without knowing it, that I preach to you:</p>
<p>24 God, who made the world and all things therein, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</p>
<p>25 Neither is he served with men&rsquo;s hands, as though he needed any thing: seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all things:</p>
<p>26 And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times and the limits of their habitation.</p>
<p>27 That they should seek God, if haply they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us.</p>
<p>28 For in him we live and move and are: as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.</p>
<p>29 Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone, the graving of art and device of man.</p>
<p>30 And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men that all should every where do penance.</p>
<p>31 Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed: giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.</p>
<p>32 And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked. But others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</p>
<p>33 So Paul went out from among them.</p>
<p>34 But certain men, adhering to him, did believe: among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</p>
