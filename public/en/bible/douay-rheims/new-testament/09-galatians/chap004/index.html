<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,</p>
<p>2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.</p>
<p>3 So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.</p>
<p>4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:</p>
<p>5 That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p>
<p>6 And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.</p>
<p>7 Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.</p>
<p>8 But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature, are not gods.</p>
<p>9 But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to serve again?</p>
<p>10 You observe days and months and times, and years.</p>
<p>11 I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.</p>
<p>12 Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You have not injured me at all.</p>
<p>13 And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh</p>
<p>14 You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>15 Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me.</p>
<p>16 Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>
<p>17 They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.</p>
<p>18 But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.</p>
<p>19 My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.</p>
<p>20 And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</p>
<p>21 Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?</p>
<p>22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman.</p>
<p>23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise.</p>
<p>24 Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is Agar.</p>
<p>25 For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.</p>
<p>26 But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.</p>
<p>27 For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</p>
<p>28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
<p>29 But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit: so also it is now.</p>
<p>30 But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</p>
<p>31 So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</p>
