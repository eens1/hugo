<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>1 O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?</p>
<p>2 This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p>3 Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?</p>
<p>4 Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.</p>
<p>5 He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of the faith?</p>
<p>6 As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.</p>
<p>7 Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p>
<p>8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>
<p>9 Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
<p>10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
<p>11 But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</p>
<p>12 But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall live in them.</p>
<p>13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree).</p>
<p>14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</p>
<p>15 Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man&rsquo;s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.</p>
<p>16 To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
<p>17 Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</p>
<p>18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
<p>19 Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
<p>20 Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</p>
<p>21 Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</p>
<p>22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</p>
<p>23 But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</p>
<p>24 Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be justified by faith.</p>
<p>25 But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</p>
<p>26 For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>27 For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ.</p>
<p>28 There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>29 And if you be Christ&rsquo;s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</p>
