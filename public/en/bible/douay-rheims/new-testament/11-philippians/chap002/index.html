<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:</p>
<p>2 Fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.</p>
<p>3 Let nothing be done through contention: neither by vain glory. But in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:</p>
<p>4 Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>5 For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>6 Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>
<p>7 But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.</p>
<p>8 He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.</p>
<p>9 For which cause, God also hath exalted him and hath given him a name which is above all names:</p>
<p>10 That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:</p>
<p>11 And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p>12 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.</p>
<p>13 For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.</p>
<p>14 And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations:</p>
<p>15 That you may be blameless and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation: among whom you shine as lights in the world.</p>
<p>16 Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ: because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>
<p>17 Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.</p>
<p>18 And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate with me.</p>
<p>19 And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.</p>
<p>20 For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</p>
<p>21 For all seek the things that are their own not the things that are Jesus Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>22 Now know ye the proof of him: that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.</p>
<p>23 Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately: so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
<p>24 And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</p>
<p>25 But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier, but your apostle: and he that hath ministered to my wants.</p>
<p>26 For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</p>
<p>27 For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him. And not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
<p>28 Therefore, I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</p>
<p>29 Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord: and treat with honour such as he is.</p>
<p>30 Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</p>
