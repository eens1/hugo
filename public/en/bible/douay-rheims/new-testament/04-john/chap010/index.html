<h1>Chapter 10</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Amen, amen, I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p>2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p>3 To him the porter openeth: and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.</p>
<p>4 And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</p>
<p>5 But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p>6 This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke.</p>
<p>7 Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p>8 All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</p>
<p>9 I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in and go out, and shall find pastures.</p>
<p>10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly.</p>
<p>11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</p>
<p>12 But the hireling and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth: and the wolf casteth and scattereth the sheep,</p>
<p>13 And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.</p>
<p>14 I am the good shepherd: and I know mine, and mine know me.</p>
<p>15 As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.</p>
<p>16 And other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice: And there shall be one fold and one shepherd.</p>
<p>17 Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</p>
<p>18 No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself. And I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
<p>19 A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.</p>
<p>20 And many of them said: He hath a devil and is mad. Why hear you him?</p>
<p>21 Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p>22 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.</p>
<p>23 And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon&rsquo;s porch.</p>
<p>24 The Jews therefore came round about him and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p>25 Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.</p>
<p>26 But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</p>
<p>27 My sheep hear my voice. And I know them: and they follow me.</p>
<p>28 And I give them life everlasting: and they shall not perish for ever. And no man shall pluck them out of my hand.</p>
<p>29 That which my Father hath given me is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.</p>
<p>30 I and the Father are one.</p>
<p>31 The Jews then took up stones to stone him.</p>
<p>32 Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?</p>
<p>33 The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy: and because that thou. being a, man, makest thyself God.</p>
<p>34 Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said, you are gods?</p>
<p>35 If he called them gods to whom the word of God was spoken; and the scripture cannot be broken:</p>
<p>36 Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest; because I said: I am the Son of God?</p>
<p>37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p>38 But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in the Father.</p>
<p>39 They sought therefore to take him: and he escaped out of their hands.</p>
<p>40 And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first. And there he abode.</p>
<p>41 And many resorted to him: and they said: John indeed did no sign.</p>
<p>42 But all things whatsoever John said of this man were true. And many believed n him.</p>
