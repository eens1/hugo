<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.</p>
<p>2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple: and all the people came to him. And sitting down he taught them.</p>
<p>3 And the scribes and Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,</p>
<p>4 And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.</p>
<p>5 Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?</p>
<p>6 And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</p>
<p>7 When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
<p>8 And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.</p>
<p>9 But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
<p>10 Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?</p>
<p>11 Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.</p>
<p>12 Again therefore, Jesus spoke to: them, saying: I am the light of the world. He that followeth me walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
<p>13 The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself. Thy testimony is not true.</p>
<p>14 Jesus answered and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came and whither I go.</p>
<p>15 You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.</p>
<p>16 And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>
<p>17 And in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</p>
<p>18 I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.</p>
<p>19 They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father. If you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</p>
<p>20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p>21 Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go: and you shall seek me. And you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.</p>
<p>22 The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go you cannot come?</p>
<p>23 And he said to them: You are from beneath: I am from above. You are of this world: I am not of this world.</p>
<p>24 Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.</p>
<p>25 They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</p>
<p>26 Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.</p>
<p>27 And they understood not that he called God his Father.</p>
<p>28 Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up, the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself. But as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak.</p>
<p>29 And he that sent me is with me: and he hath not left me alone. For I do always the things that please him.</p>
<p>30 When he spoke these things, many believed in him.</p>
<p>31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.</p>
<p>32 And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.</p>
<p>33 They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham: and we have never been slaves to any man. How sayest thou: You shall be free?</p>
<p>34 Jesus answered them: Amen, amen, I say unto you that whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
<p>35 Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the son abideth for ever.</p>
<p>36 If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</p>
<p>37 I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
<p>38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.</p>
<p>39 They answered and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.</p>
<p>40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.</p>
<p>41 You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</p>
<p>42 Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded and came. For I came not of myself: but he sent me.</p>
<p>43 Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</p>
<p>44 You are of your father the devil: and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning: and he stood not in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</p>
<p>45 But if I say the truth, you believe me not.</p>
<p>46 Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me:</p>
<p>47 He that is of God heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.</p>
<p>48 The Jews therefore answered and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil?</p>
<p>49 Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father. And you have dishonoured me.</p>
<p>50 But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
<p>51 Amen, amen, I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.</p>
<p>52 The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets: and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</p>
<p>53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</p>
<p>54 Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.</p>
<p>55 And you have not known him: but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him and do keep his word.</p>
<p>56 Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it and was glad.</p>
<p>57 The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old. And hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
<p>58 Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I AM.</p>
<p>59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</p>
