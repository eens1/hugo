<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 These things have I spoken to you things have I spoken to you that you may not be scandalized.</p>
<p>2 They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a service to God.</p>
<p>3 And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father nor me.</p>
<p>4 But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</p>
<p>5 But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?</p>
<p>6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>
<p>7 But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go. For if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you: but if I go, I will send him to you.</p>
<p>8 And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin and of justice and of judgment.</p>
<p>9 Of sin: because they believed not in me.</p>
<p>10 And of justice: because I go to the Father: and you shall see me no longer.</p>
<p>11 And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.</p>
<p>12 I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.</p>
<p>13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself: but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak. And the things that are to come, he shall shew you.</p>
<p>14 He shall glorify me: because he shall receive of mine and shall shew it to you.</p>
<p>15 All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine. Therefore I said that he shall receive of me and shew it to you.</p>
<p>16 A little while, and now you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.</p>
<p>17 Then some of his disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, Because I go to the Father?</p>
<p>18 They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he speaketh.</p>
<p>19 And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him. And he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?</p>
<p>20 Amen, amen, I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
<p>21 A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p>22 So also you now indeed have sorrow: but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice. And your joy no man shall take from you.</p>
<p>23 And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen, I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.</p>
<p>24 Hitherto, you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.</p>
<p>25 These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
<p>26 In that day, you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you that I will ask the Father for you.</p>
<p>27 For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
<p>28 I came forth from the Father and am come into the world: again I leave the world and I go to the Father.</p>
<p>29 His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly and speakest no proverb.</p>
<p>30 Now we know that thou knowest all things and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
<p>31 Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?</p>
<p>32 Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p>33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress. But have confidence. I have overcome the world.</p>
