<h1>Chapter 17</h1>

<p>1 These things Jesus spoke: and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: the hour is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.</p>
<p>2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.</p>
<p>3 Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p>4 I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</p>
<p>5 And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.</p>
<p>6 I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were: and to me thou gavest them. And they have kept thy word.</p>
<p>7 Now they have known that all things which thou hast given me are from thee:</p>
<p>8 Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them. And they have received them and have known in very deed that I came out from thee: and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>
<p>9 I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine.</p>
<p>10 And all my things are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p>11 And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou hast given me: that they may be one, as we also are.</p>
<p>12 While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept: and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition: that the scripture may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>13 And now I come to thee: and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.</p>
<p>14 I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them: because they are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.</p>
<p>15 I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.</p>
<p>16 They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.</p>
<p>17 Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.</p>
<p>18 As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</p>
<p>19 And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</p>
<p>20 And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me.</p>
<p>21 That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>22 And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them: that, they may be one, as we also are one.</p>
<p>23 I in them, and thou in me: that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.</p>
<p>24 Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me: that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.</p>
<p>25 Just Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee. And these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>26 And I have made known thy name to them and will make it known: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</p>
