<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>1 And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.</p>
<p>2 And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
<p>3 And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine.</p>
<p>4 And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? My hour is not yet come.</p>
<p>5 His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.</p>
<p>6 Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.</p>
<p>7 Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>
<p>8 And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.</p>
<p>9 And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water: the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,</p>
<p>10 And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
<p>11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p>
<p>12 After this, he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.</p>
<p>13 And the pasch of the Jews was at hand: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14 And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</p>
<p>15 And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen: and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.</p>
<p>16 And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic.</p>
<p>17 And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</p>
<p>18 The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?</p>
<p>19 Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple; and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p>20 The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</p>
<p>21 But he spoke of the temple of his body.</p>
<p>22 When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this: and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had said.</p>
<p>23 Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.</p>
<p>24 But Jesus did not trust himself unto them: for that he knew all men,</p>
<p>25 And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
