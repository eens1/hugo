<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 When Jesus therefore understood the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples and baptizeth more than John</p>
<p>2 (Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples),</p>
<p>3 He left Judea and went again into Galilee.</p>
<p>4 And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.</p>
<p>5 He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
<p>6 Now Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p>7 There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.</p>
<p>8 For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.</p>
<p>9 Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew; ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</p>
<p>10 Jesus answered and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God and who he is that saith to thee: Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
<p>11 The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou living water?</p>
<p>12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof, himself and his children and his cattle?</p>
<p>13 Jesus answered and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst for ever.</p>
<p>14 But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</p>
<p>15 The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</p>
<p>16 Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
<p>17 The woman answered and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well: I have no husband.</p>
<p>18 For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This, thou hast said truly.</p>
<p>19 The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
<p>20 Our fathers adored on this mountain: and you say that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</p>
<p>21 Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father.</p>
<p>22 You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know. For salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p>23 But the hour cometh and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.</p>
<p>24 God is a spirit: and they that adore him must adore him in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p>25 The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ): therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
<p>26 Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</p>
<p>27 And immediately his disciples came. And they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? Or: Why talkest thou with her?</p>
<p>28 The woman therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men there:</p>
<p>29 Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?</p>
<p>30 They went therefore out of the city and came unto him.</p>
<p>31 In the mean time, the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</p>
<p>32 But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you know not.</p>
<p>33 The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?</p>
<p>34 Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</p>
<p>35 Do not you say: There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries. For they are white already to harvest.</p>
<p>36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
<p>37 For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</p>
<p>38 I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour. Others have laboured: and you have entered into their labours.</p>
<p>39 Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</p>
<p>40 So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</p>
<p>41 And many more believed in him, because of his own word.</p>
<p>42 And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>43 Now after two days, he departed thence and went into Galilee.</p>
<p>44 For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
<p>45 And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day: for they also went to the festival day.</p>
<p>46 He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.</p>
<p>47 He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, sent to him and prayed him to come down and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
<p>48 Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.</p>
<p>49 The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</p>
<p>50 Jesus saith to him: Go thy way. Thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.</p>
<p>51 And as he was going down, his servants met him: and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</p>
<p>52 He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</p>
<p>53 The father therefore knew that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him: Thy son liveth. And himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
<p>54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea. into Galilee.</p>
