<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I am the true vine: and my Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p>2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>
<p>3 Now you are clean, by reason of the word which I have spoken to you.</p>
<p>4 Abide in me: and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.</p>
<p>5 I am the vine: you the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.</p>
<p>6 If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch and shall wither: and they shall gather him up and cast him into the fire: and he burneth.</p>
<p>7 If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will: and it shall be done unto you.</p>
<p>8 In this is my Father glorified: that you bring forth very much fruit and become my disciples.</p>
<p>9 As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love.</p>
<p>10 If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love: as I also have kept my Father&rsquo;s commandments and do abide in his love.</p>
<p>11 These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled.</p>
<p>12 This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
<p>13 Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>
<p>14 You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.</p>
<p>15 I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends. because all things, whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.</p>
<p>16 You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>
<p>17 These things I command you, that you love one another.</p>
<p>18 If the world hate you, know ye that it hath hated me before you.</p>
<p>19 If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>
<p>20 Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.</p>
<p>21 But all these things they will do to you for my name&rsquo;s sake: because they know not him that sent me.</p>
<p>22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.</p>
<p>23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p>
<p>24 If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</p>
<p>25 But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: they hated me without cause.</p>
<p>26 But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.</p>
<p>27 And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.</p>
