<h1>Chapter 18</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 When Jesus had said these things, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.</p>
<p>2 And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples.</p>
<p>3 Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>
<p>4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and said to them: Whom seek ye?</p>
<p>5 They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.</p>
<p>6 As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>7 Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said: Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>8 Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,</p>
<p>9 That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.</p>
<p>10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. And the name of thee servant was Malchus.</p>
<p>11 Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</p>
<p>12 Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took Jesus and bound him.</p>
<p>13 And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.</p>
<p>14 Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>
<p>15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus: and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.</p>
<p>16 But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the portress and brought in Peter.</p>
<p>17 The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man&rsquo;s disciple? He saith I am not.</p>
<p>18 Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing and warming himself.</p>
<p>19 The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.</p>
<p>20 Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort: and in secret I have spoken nothing.</p>
<p>21 Why askest thou me? Ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them. Behold they know what things I have said.</p>
<p>22 And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?</p>
<p>23 Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?</p>
<p>24 And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.</p>
<p>25 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it and said: I am not.</p>
<p>26 One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</p>
<p>27 Again therefore Peter denied: and immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p>28 Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor&rsquo;s hall. And it was morning: and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.</p>
<p>29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?</p>
<p>30 They answered and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</p>
<p>31 Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.</p>
<p>32 That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
<p>33 Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called Jesus and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?</p>
<p>34 Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?</p>
<p>35 Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me. What hast thou done?</p>
<p>36 Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.</p>
<p>37 Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</p>
<p>38 Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews and saith to them: I find no cause in him.</p>
<p>39 But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the Pasch. Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</p>
<p>40 Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
