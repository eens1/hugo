<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Jesus passing by, saw a man who was blind from his birth.</p>
<p>2 And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p>
<p>3 Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
<p>4 I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
<p>5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p>6 When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes,</p>
<p>7 And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed: and he came seeing.</p>
<p>8 The neighbours, therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</p>
<p>9 But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</p>
<p>10 They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</p>
<p>11 He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe and wash. And I went: I washed: and I see.</p>
<p>12 And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.</p>
<p>13 They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.</p>
<p>14 Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>15 Again therefore the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes: and I washed: and I see.</p>
<p>16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p>17 They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.</p>
<p>18 The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</p>
<p>19 And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</p>
<p>20 His parents answered them and said: We know that this is our son and that he was born blind:</p>
<p>21 But how he now seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, we know not. Ask himself: he is of age: Let him speak for himself.</p>
<p>22 These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p>23 Therefore did his parents say: He is of age. Ask himself.</p>
<p>24 They therefore called the man again that had been blind and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p>25 He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not. One thing I know, that whereas I was blind. now I see.</p>
<p>26 They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</p>
<p>27 He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard. Why would you hear it again? Will you also become his disciples?</p>
<p>28 They reviled him therefore and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</p>
<p>29 We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.</p>
<p>30 The man answered and said to them: why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</p>
<p>31 Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God and doth his, will, him he heareth.</p>
<p>32 From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</p>
<p>33 Unless this man were of God, he could not do anything.</p>
<p>34 They answered and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins; and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p>35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</p>
<p>36 He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</p>
<p>37 And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
<p>38 And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</p>
<p>39 And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world: that they who see not may see; and they who see may become blind.</p>
<p>40 And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</p>
<p>41 Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</p>
