<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God: believe also in me.</p>
<p>2 In my Father&rsquo;s house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p>3 And if I shall go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself: that where I am, you also may be.</p>
<p>4 And whither I go you know: and the way you know.</p>
<p>5 Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest. And how can we know the way?</p>
<p>6 Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</p>
<p>7 If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him. And you have seen him.</p>
<p>8 Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father; and it is enough for us.</p>
<p>9 Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou: Shew us the Father?</p>
<p>10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.</p>
<p>11 Believe you not that I am in the Father and the Father in me?</p>
<p>12 Otherwise believe for the very works&rsquo; sake. Amen, amen, I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do: and greater than these shall he do.</p>
<p>13 Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p>14 If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.</p>
<p>15 If you love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p>16 And I will ask the Father: and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever:</p>
<p>17 The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him. But you shall know him; because he shall abide with you and shall be in you.</p>
<p>18 I will not leave you orphans: I will come to you.</p>
<p>19 Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.</p>
<p>20 In that day you shall know that I am in my Father: and you in me, and I in you.</p>
<p>21 He that hath my commandments and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.</p>
<p>22 Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</p>
<p>23 Jesus answered and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word. And my Father will love him and we will come to him and will make our abode with him.</p>
<p>24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard is not mine; but the Father&rsquo;s who sent me.</p>
<p>25 These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.</p>
<p>26 But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.</p>
<p>27 Peace I leave with you: my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled: nor let it be afraid.</p>
<p>28 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</p>
<p>29 And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</p>
<p>30 I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world: cometh: and in me he hath not any thing.</p>
<p>31 But that the world may know that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandments, so do I. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
