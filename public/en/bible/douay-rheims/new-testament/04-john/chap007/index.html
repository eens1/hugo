<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p>2 Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p>3 And his brethren said to, him: Pass from hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.</p>
<p>4 For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</p>
<p>5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
<p>6 Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</p>
<p>7 The world cannot hate you: but me it hateth, because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil,</p>
<p>8 Go you up to this festival day: but I go not up to this festival day, because my time is not accomplished.</p>
<p>9 When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</p>
<p>10 But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</p>
<p>11 The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day and said: Where is he?</p>
<p>12 And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</p>
<p>13 Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p>14 Now, about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</p>
<p>15 And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</p>
<p>16 Jesus answered them and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p>17 If any man will do the will of him, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
<p>18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true and there is no injustice in him.</p>
<p>19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</p>
<p>20 Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a devil. Who seeketh to kill thee?</p>
<p>21 Jesus answered and said to them: One work I have done: and you all wonder.</p>
<p>22 Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers): and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.</p>
<p>23 If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken: are you angry at me, because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</p>
<p>24 Judge not according to the appearance: but judge just judgment.</p>
<p>25 Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p>26 And behold, he speaketh openly: and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth that this is the Christ?</p>
<p>27 But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth, whence he is.</p>
<p>28 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am. And I am not come of myself: but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.</p>
<p>29 I know him, because I am from him: and he hath sent me.</p>
<p>30 They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p>31 But of the people many believed in him and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles than this man doth?</p>
<p>32 The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.</p>
<p>33 Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</p>
<p>34 You shall seek me and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</p>
<p>35 The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p>36 What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me and shall not find me? And: Where I am, you cannot come?</p>
<p>37 And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</p>
<p>38 He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith: Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p>39 Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
<p>40 Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</p>
<p>41 Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p>42 Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the town where David was?</p>
<p>43 So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</p>
<p>44 And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands upon him.</p>
<p>45 The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</p>
<p>46 The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.</p>
<p>47 The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</p>
<p>48 Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</p>
<p>49 But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</p>
<p>50 Nicodemus said to them (he that came to him by night, who was one of them):</p>
<p>51 Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him and know what he doth?</p>
<p>52 They answered and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</p>
<p>53 And every man returned to his own house.</p>
