      <description>1 Ask ye of the Lord rain in the latter season, and the Lord will make snows, and will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.&#xA;2 For the idols have spoken what was unprofitable, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have spoken vanity: they comforted in vain: therefore they were led away as a flock: they shall be afflicted, because they have no shepherd.</description>

      <description>1 When these covenants were made, Lysias went to the king, and the Jews gave themselves to husbandry.&#xA;2 But they that were behind, viz. Timotheus, and Apollonius, the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and besides them Nicanor, the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to live in peace, and to be quiet.&#xA;3 The men of Joppe also were guilty of this kind of wickedness: they desired the Jews, who dwelt among them, to go with their wives and children into the boats, which they had prepared, as though they had no enmity to them.</description>

      <description>1 Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.&#xA;2 And seeing that the people was in dread and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people,&#xA;3 And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:</description>

      <description>1 In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas understood that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a multitude against Judea,&#xA;2 And with him Lysias, the regent, who had charge over the affairs of the realm, having with him a hundred and ten thousand footmen, five thousand horsemen, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots.&#xA;3 Menelaus also joined himself with them: and with great deceitfulness besought Antiochus, not for the welfare of his country, but in hopes that he should be appointed chief ruler.</description>

      <description>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:&#xA;2 Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.&#xA;3 And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.&#xA;4 And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.</description>

      <description>1 And the Lord said to me: Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress: as the Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the grapes.&#xA;2 And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core of barley.&#xA;3 And I said to her: Thou shalt wait for me many days: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt be no man&amp;rsquo;s, and I also will wait for thee.</description>

      <description>1 For behold in those days, and in that time when I shall bring back the captivity of Juda, and Jerusalem:&#xA;2 I will gather together all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: and I will plead with them there for my people, and for my inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and have parted my land.&#xA;3 And they have cast lots upon my people: and the boy they have put in the stews, and the girl they have sold for wine, that they might drink.</description>

Go, ye swift angels, to a nation rent and torn in pieces: to a terrible people, after which there is no other: to a nation expecting and trodden underfoot, whose land the rivers have spoiled.&#xA;3 All ye inhabitants of the world, who dwell on the earth, when the sign shall be lifted up on the mountains, you shall see, and you shall hear the sound of the trumpet.</description>

      <description>1 Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.&#xA;2 Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.&#xA;3 Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.&#xA;4 Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.&#xA;5 Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall, and labour.</description>

      <description>1 Let the islands keep silence before me, and the nations take new strength: let them come near, and then speak, let us come near to judgment together.&#xA;2 Who hath raised up the just one from the east, hath called him to follow him? he shall give the nations in his sight, and he shall rule over kings: he shall give them as the dust to his sword, as stubble driven by the wind, to his bow.</description>

      <description>1 Give praise, O thou barren, that bearest not: sing forth praise, and make a joyful noise, thou that didst not travail with child: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband, saith the Lord.&#xA;2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and stretch out the skins of thy tabernacles, spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.&#xA;3 For thou shalt pass on to the right hand, and to the left: and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and shall inhabit the desolate cities.</description>

Hearken diligently to me, and eat that which is good, and your soul shall be delighted in fatness.</description>

      <description>1 The vision of Isaiah the Son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.&#xA;2 Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.&#xA;3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&amp;rsquo;s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.</description>

      <description>1 A wise son maketh the father glad: but a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother.&#xA;2 Treasures of wickedness shall profit nothing: but justice shall deliver from death.&#xA;3 The Lord will not afflict the soul of the just with famine, and he will disappoint the deceitful practices of the wicked.&#xA;4 The slothful hand hath wrought poverty: but the hand of the industrious getteth riches. He that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds: and the same runneth after birds, that fly away.</description>

      <description>1 Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.&#xA;2 The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.&#xA;3 Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.&#xA;4 If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.</description>

      <description>1 He that hath a mind to depart from a friend, seeketh occasions: he shall ever be subject to reproach.&#xA;2 A fool receiveth not the words of prudence: unless thou say those things which are in his heart.&#xA;3 The wicked man, when he is come into the depths of sins, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him.&#xA;4 Words from the mouth of a man are as deep water: and the fountain of wisdom is an overflowing stream.</description>

      <description>1 But thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:&#xA;2 And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.&#xA;3 Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a good entertainment.</description>

      <description>1 But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:&#xA;2 For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them away with great care, they repented and pursued after them.&#xA;3 For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:</description>

      <description>1 The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth: but the just, bold as a lion, shall be without dread.&#xA;2 For the sins of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the life of the prince shall be prolonged.&#xA;3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.</description>

      <description>1 He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.&#xA;2 Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurt thee: and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest.&#xA;3 Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God?&#xA;4 He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins?</description>

      <description>1 The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him, shall suddenly be destroyed: and health shall not follow him.&#xA;2 When just men increase, the people shall rejoice: when the wicked shall bear rule, the people shall mourn.&#xA;3 A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his father: but he that maintaineth harlots, shall squander away his substance.&#xA;4 A just king setteth up the land: a covetous man shall destroy it.</description>

      <description>1 O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions!&#xA;2 To a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!&#xA;3 O death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need, and to him whose strength faileth:&#xA;4 Who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that loseth patience!</description>

      <description>1 Repeat not the word which thou hast heard, and disclose not the thing that is secret; so shalt thou be truly without confusion, and shalt find favour before all men: be not ashamed of any of these things, and accept no person to sin thereby:&#xA;2 Of the law of the most High, and of his covenant, and of judgment to justify the ungodly:&#xA;3 Of the affair of companions and travellers, and of the gift of the inheritance of friends:</description>

      <description>1 The firmament on high is his beauty, the beauty of heaven with its glorious shew.&#xA;2 The sun when he appeareth shewing forth at his rising, an admirable instrument, the work of the most High.&#xA;3 At noon he burneth the earth, and who can abide his burning heat? As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:&#xA;4 The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.</description>

This is vanity and a great misery.&#xA;3 If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he.</description>

      <description>1 The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.&#xA;2 I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath of God.&#xA;3 Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him:&#xA;4 And his word is full of power: neither can any man say to him: Why dost thou so?</description>

      <description>1 Who shall give thee to me for my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother, that I may find thee without, and kiss thee, and now no man may despise me?&#xA;2 I will take hold of thee, and bring thee into my mother&amp;rsquo;s house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates.&#xA;3 His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.</description>

I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.&#xA;3 I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the workers of iniquities.&#xA;4 The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. I rejoiced at the things that were said to me: We shall go into the house of the Lord.&#xA;2 Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem.&#xA;3 Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together.&#xA;4 For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: the testimony of Israel, to praise the name of the Lord.&#xA;5 Because their seats have sat in judgment, seats upon the house of David.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding.&#xA;2 We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to us, The work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.&#xA;3 Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou didst afflict the people and cast them out.&#xA;4 For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: neither did their own arm save them.</description>

      <description>1 A psalm on Solomon.&#xA;2 Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king&amp;rsquo;s son thy justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.&#xA;3 Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the hills justice.&#xA;4 He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.&#xA;5 And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon, throughout all generations.</description>

      <description>1 A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!&#xA;2 But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.&#xA;3 Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.&#xA;4 For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.&#xA;5 They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men.</description>

      <description>1 Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?&#xA;2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.&#xA;3 Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</description>

      <description>1 A psalm for Asaph.

      <description>1 Behold my eye hath seen all these things, and my ear hath heard them, and I have understood them all.&#xA;2 According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.&#xA;3 But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.&#xA;4 Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.&#xA;5 And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God. They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.&#xA;2 The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.&#xA;3 They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good: no not one.</description>

      <description>1 And the words of Tobias were ended. And after Tobias was restored to his sight, he lived two and forty years, and saw the children of his grandchildren.&#xA;2 And after he had lived a hundred and two years, he was buried honorably in Ninive.&#xA;3 For he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his eyes, and sixty when he recovered it again.</description>

      <description>1 And Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls.&#xA;2 And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every man take his arms, and rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.&#xA;3 Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle.&#xA;4 And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them.</description>

      <description>1 Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.&#xA;2 And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.</description>

Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?&#xA;2 He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:&#xA;3 He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.&#xA;4 In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord.</description>

      <description>1 Times are not hid from the Almighty: but they that know him, know not his days.&#xA;2 Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and fed them.&#xA;3 They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken away the widow&amp;rsquo;s ox for a pledge.&#xA;4 They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth.&#xA;5 Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their children.</description>

      <description>1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:&#xA;2 Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places.&#xA;3 Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?&#xA;4 Can man be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a woman appear clean?&#xA;5 Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight.</description>

      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:&#xA;2 Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?&#xA;3 To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.&#xA;4 Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?&#xA;5 Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</description>

      <description>1 But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim. And passing towards the north, they said to Jephte: When thou wentest to fight against the children of Ammon, why wouldst thou not call us, that we might go with thee? Therefore we will burn thy house.&#xA;2 And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.</description>

According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be:</description>

      <description>1 Now, faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.&#xA;2 For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.&#xA;3 By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God: that from invisible things visible things might be made.&#xA;4 By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts.</description>

      <description>1 And there was given me a reed, like unto a rod. And it was said to me: Arise, and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that adore therein.&#xA;2 But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles. And the holy city they shall tread under foot, two and forty months:&#xA;3 And I will give unto my two witnesses: and they shall prophesy, a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</description>

      <description>1 And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.&#xA;2 And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.&#xA;3 And each one said to his neighbour: Come let us make brick, and bake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stones, and slime instead of mortar:&#xA;4 And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.</description>

      <description>1 And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over our head, laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:&#xA;2 Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who, having joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.&#xA;3 For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.</description>

And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.</description>

And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.&#xA;3 And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.</description>

I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.&#xA;3 And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant born in my house, shall be my heir.</description>

And when he agreed to her request,&#xA;3 She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These things saith he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:&#xA;2 I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and are not: and hast found them liars:</description>

      <description>1 So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.&#xA;2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.&#xA;3 And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.&#xA;4 These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:</description>

      <description>1 And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids.&#xA;2 And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.&#xA;3 And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.</description>

      <description>1 Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&#xA;2 By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:&#xA;3 And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world.</description>

      <description>1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.&#xA;2 In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.&#xA;3 For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not heavy.&#xA;4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.</description>

In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.&#xA;2 He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.&#xA;3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.</description>

These things teach and exhort.&#xA;3 If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,</description>

      <description>1 And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band:&#xA;2 A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to the people and always praying to God.&#xA;3 This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him and saying to him: Cornelius.</description>

      <description>1 Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is for them unto salvation.&#xA;2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.&#xA;3 For they, not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.&#xA;4 For the end of the law is Christ: unto justice to everyone that believeth.</description>

And behold, there was a certain disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman that believed: but his father was a Gentile.&#xA;2 To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony.&#xA;3 Him Paul would have to go along with him: and taking him, he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places.</description>

      <description>1 And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,&#xA;2 Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.&#xA;3 And the day following, we came to Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of himself.</description>

      <description>1 And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.&#xA;2 For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.&#xA;3 And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.</description>

      <description>1 Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.&#xA;2 And a certain man who was lame from his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.&#xA;3 He, when he had seen Peter and John, about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.</description>

      <description>1 What advantage then hath the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?&#xA;2 Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.&#xA;3 For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!&#xA;4 But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: That thou mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</description>

As unto little ones in Christ.&#xA;2 I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.&#xA;3 For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?</description>

      <description>1 And in those days, the number of the disciples increasing, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, for that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.&#xA;2 Then the twelve, calling together the multitude of the disciples, said: It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.&#xA;3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</description>

      <description>1 What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?&#xA;2 God forbid! For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?&#xA;3 Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?&#xA;4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death: that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.</description>

      <description>1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?&#xA;2 Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?&#xA;3 Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?&#xA;4 If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.</description>

Behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day of salvation.&#xA;3 Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.&#xA;4 But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</description>

      <description>1 Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.&#xA;2 Bear ye one another&amp;rsquo;s burdens: and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.&#xA;3 For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.&#xA;4 But let every one prove his own work: and so he shall have glory in himself only and not in another.</description>

But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.&#xA;3 Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.</description>

      <description>1 And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,&#xA;2 And saith to them: Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat. Loose him and bring him.&#xA;3 And if any man shall say to you: What are you doing?</description>

      <description>1 And it came to pass that as he was in a certain place praying, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.&#xA;2 And he said to them: When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.&#xA;3 Give us this day our daily bread.&#xA;4 And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.</description>

      <description>1 Judge not, that you may not be judged.&#xA;2 For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.&#xA;3 And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother&amp;rsquo;s eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?&#xA;4 Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</description>

      <description>1 And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.&#xA;2 And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.&#xA;3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients.&#xA;4 And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.</description>

      <description>1 After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.&#xA;2 Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand.&#xA;3 And his brethren said to, him: Pass from hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.&#xA;4 For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.</description>
