<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>Let all the brothers strive to follow the humility and poverty of our Lord Jesus Christ, and let them remember that we ought to have nothing else in the whole world, except as the Apostle says: &ldquo;Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they ought to rejoice when they converse with mean and despised persons, with the poor and the weak, with the infirm and lepers, and with those who beg in the streets. And when it may be necessary, let them go for alms. And let them not beashamed thereof, but rather remember that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living and Omnipotent God, set His face &ldquo;as a hard rock,&rdquo; and was not ashamed, and was poor, and a stranger, and lived on alms, He Himself and the Blessed Virgin and His disciples.</p>
<p>And when men may treat them with contempt, and refuse to give them an alms, let them give thanks for this to God, because for these shames they shall receive great honor before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ. And let them know that the injuries shall not be imputed to those who suffer them, but to those who offer them.</p>
<p>And alms is an inheritance and a right which is due to the poor, which our Lord Jesus Christ purchased for us. And the brothers who labor in seeking it will have a great recompense, and they will procure and acquire a reward for those who give; for all that men leave in this world shall perish, but for the charity and alms-deeds they have done they will receive a reward from God.</p>
<p>And let one make known clearly his wants to another, in order that he may find and receive what are necessary for him. And let everyone love and nourish his brother as a mother loves and nourishes her son, in so far as God gives them grace. And &ldquo;let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And whensoever a necessity shall arise, it is lawful for all the brothers, wherever they may be, to eat of all food that men can eat, as our Lord said of David, who &ldquo;did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests.&rdquo; And let them remember what the Lord says: &ldquo;and take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life: and that they come upon you suddenly. For as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of the whole arth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in like manner in time of manifest necessity let all the brothers act in their needs, as our Lord shall give them grace, for necessity has no law.</p>
