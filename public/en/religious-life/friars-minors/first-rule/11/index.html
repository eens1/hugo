<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>And let all the brothers take care not to calumniate anyone, nor to contend in words; let them indeed study to maintain silence as far as God gives them grace. Let them also not dispute among themselves or with others, but let them be ready to answer with humility, saying: &ldquo;we are unprofitable servants.&rdquo; And let them not be angry, for &ldquo;whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And let them love one another, as the Lord says: &ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you.&rdquo; And let them show their love by the works they do for each other, according as the Apostle says: &ldquo;let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.&rdquo; Let them &ldquo;speak evil of no man,&rdquo; nor murmur, nor detract others, for it is written: &ldquo;Whisperers and detractors are hateful to God.&rdquo; And let them be &ldquo;gentle, showing all mildness toward all men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let them not judge and not condemn, and, as the Lord says, let them not pay attention to the least sins of others, but rather let them recount their own in the bitterness of their soul. And let them &ldquo;strive to enter by the narrow gate,&rdquo; for the Lord says: &ldquo;Flow narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life, and few there are that find it!&rdquo;</p>
