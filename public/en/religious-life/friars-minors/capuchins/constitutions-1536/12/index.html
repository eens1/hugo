<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>(139) In order to safeguard the pure observance of the Rule, as well as to ensure the proper performance of the divine services, and at the same time to observe most high poverty, we ordain that in our Friaries there shall not be less than six nor more than twelve Friars, who, united in the sweet name of Jesus, shall be of one heart and one soul ever striving to arrive at greater perfection. And if they would be true disciples of Christ, let them cordially love one another, bearing with each other’s defects, exercising themselves in divine love and fraternal charity, striving to give a good example to one another and to everyone, doing constant violence to their own passions and evil inclinations, because as our Saviour says: “The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent, that is, those who do violence to themselves, bear it away.”</p>
<p>(140) We also ordain that in our churches there shall be only one small bell, about one hundred and fifty pounds in weight. In our churches there shall be no other sacristy but a case, or chest, with a good key which shall be kept by a professed Friar. In this case or chest shall be stored all requisites for divine worship. They shall have two small chalices, one of tin and the other with only the cup of silver. They shall not have more than three simple vestments without gold, silver, velvet or silk, or anything costly or superfluous, but everything must be neat and clean. The altar linens shall be plain; the candlesticks shall be of wood. Our missals, breviaries, and other books shall be plainly bound and without any ornate bookmarks, so that in everything we use holy poverty is seen resplendent, which will make us yearn after the riches of heaven where are all our treasures, our joys and our glory.</p>
<p>(141) Since it is impossible to lay down laws and statutes for every individual case that may arise, the number of them being indefinite, we exhort all our Friars, in the charity of Christ, to keep before their minds in all their actions the Holy Gospel, the Rule they have promised, the holy and praiseworthy customs and examples of the Saints, by directing their thoughts, words and actions to the honour and glory of God and the salvation of their neighbour. Thus will the Holy Spirit enlighten them in all things.</p>
<p>(142) To maintain uniformity in the divine services, both in choir and in every other place, the teaching of St Bonaventure and the ordinances of our first Fathers shall be read. To better understand the mind of our Seraphic Father, the Friars shall read his “Fioretti“, the “Book of Conformity”, and the other books that speak of him.</p>
<p>(143) As our Seraphic Father had the conversion of unbelievers very much at heart, in accordance with the Rule, it is ordained that if any Friars, inflamed with love for Christ and zeal for the Catholic Faith, wish through divine inspiration to preach to the infidels, they shall have recourse to their Vicar Provincials or to the Vicar General. Should the Superiors judge them fit, they shall send them with their permission and blessing on such an arduous mission. Let the subjects not rashly presume to judge themselves competent for such dangerous and difficult works, but with all fear and humility, let them submit their wishes to their Superior’s judgement. It is well, indeed, to draw a distinction between unbelievers who are gentle, docile, and well disposed to receive the Christian Faith, as are those recently discovered by the Spaniards, or Portuguese in the Indies, and the Turks and Hagarenes who, by force of arms and cruel persecution, maintain and defend their pernicious sect. The Superiors shall not think about the fewness of the friars, nor be sad to see good friars leave, but casting all care and solicitude on Him, Who has unceasing care of us, let them act in all things as the Spirit of God will inspire them, and arrange all with charity, which does all things well.</p>
<p>(144) In order that beloved poverty, the holy spouse of Christ our Lord, so dear to our Father, may ever remain with us, let the friars be careful not to allow any costliness, rarity or superfluity to appear in the things appertaining to divine worship, or in our buildings or in the furniture we use, remembering that God wishes from us rather our obedience promised in holy poverty, than sacrifices. And as Pope Clement says in his declaration, God desires a pure heart and holy deeds rather than costly and richly adorned things. Nevertheless, cleanliness must shine forth in our poverty.</p>
<p>(145) And as our Saviour first began to do and then to teach others, in like manner our Prelates shall be the first to comply with these Constitutions, and then with all holy and efficacious zeal, induce their subjects to observe them inviolably. And should certain things appear somewhat difficult in the beginning, habit will make them easy and pleasant. To impress them more deeply on the minds of the Friars, and that they observe them, all the Guardians shall have them read at table once every month. And although we have no intention by these Constitutions to bind the friars under pain of any sin, yet it is our wish and command that transgressors of them be severely punished. And if the Guardians are remiss in their observance or in causing them to be observed they shall be still more severely punished by the Vicar Provincials, and these latter by the Father Vicar General.</p>
<p>(146) Since the present Constitutions were drawn up with the greatest care and mature deliberation, and approved by our whole General Chapter and by the Apostolic See, we enact that they be not changed without the consent of the General Chapter. We also exhort all our father and Brothers present and to come, not to change these Constitutions – even in the Chapters. Experience has proved that great injury has been done to Religious Orders by the frequent alteration of their Constitutions. Nor shall provincial Constitutions be framed, but if particular cases arise they shall be provided for by General Chapters. These Constitutions shall be left intact and in accordance with them our Congregation should live and be governed with a holy uniformity.</p>
<p>(147) As our Seraphic Father, when on the point of death, bequeathed the fruitful blessing of the Most Holy Trinity, together with his own, to the zealous and true observance of the Rule; let us all, therefore, shaking off all negligence, assiduously apply ourselves with sincerity and devotedness to the observance of the perfection which the said Rule and our Order propose and inculcate.</p>
<p>(148) Let the Friars remember that to obey with no other intention than to escape punishment belongs solely to slaves and hirelings, but to obey for the love of God and for the glory and the pleasure of the Divine Majesty, and to give a good example to our neighbour and for other similar motives, pertains to the true children of God. Let the Friars beware of transgressing these Constitutions on the plea that they do not oblige under pain of sin; but, recognising the spirit by which we were born, let them observe inviolably the laws, ordinances, and statutes of our Congregation, that grace may be added to their head. Thus shall they, by this holy service, merit the Divine Mercy, and become conformable to the Son of God, Who though not bound by the laws He himself made, nevertheless observed them for the salvation of others. Let them, therefore, uphold the sublimity of the Religious State and become the source of much benefit to their neighbours. Let them remember that it behoves good servants not only to fulfil the commands of their lords and masters, imposed under threats of punishment, but to please them in many other ways.</p>
<p>(149) Wherefore, in fulfilling these duties, let us keep our eyes upon our Redeemer, so that knowing His good pleasure we may strive to please Him, not only by not despising the present Constitutions (for contempt of them would be a grave sin), but through love of Him avoiding all negligence in their observance. This observance will be a help to us to be faithful not only to the Rule, but to the divine law and Gospel counsels. The grace of God, through Jesus Christ, will deliver us from all dangers. As our labours abound so also will our consolations in Christ Jesus. We can do all things in Him Who strengthens us, namely in Christ Who is omnipotent, and in everything shall we be given understanding by Him Who is the Power, Wisdom, and Saviour, Who gives abundantly to all men and does not censure them. He who upholds all things by His powerful word will supply the strength.</p>
<p>(150) Let us, dearest Fathers and Brothers, frequently call to mind that sacred and memorable text, on which our Seraphic Father preached a most impressive sermon to more than 5000 Friars: “Great things we have promised to God, but greater things has He promised unto us.” Let us observe the things we have promised, and with ardent longing yearn after the things that have been promised to us. The pleasures of this life are short, but the pains of hell incurred by pursuing them are never ending. The sufferings which we bear for the love if Christ, and the penance which we do for His sake will last but a short time; but the glory, with which God will reward us, will never end. Many have been called to the kingdom of life eternal, but few have been chosen, because very few follow Christ in sincerity of heart. But on the last day God will give to each the reward of his deeds; to the good, the glory of Heaven; to the wicked, the confusion of everlasting fire.</p>
<p>(151) Great, indeed, are the things we have promised, yet they are nothing in comparison with the eternal reward God will bestow upon us if we remain faithful. Let us therefore act manfully, and not distrust our strength, because the best of Fathers Who has created us and has called us to a life of evangelical perfection, knowing our condition, will give us not only strength by His aid, but also heavenly gifts in such abundance, that, surmounting all obstacles, we shall be able not merely to obey His Most Beloved Son, but even to follow and imitate Him with the greatest cheerfulness and simplicity of heart; utterly despising those visible and temporal things, and ever yearning after those which are heavenly and eternal.</p>
<p>(152) In Christ then, Who is God and Man, the True Light, the Brightness of Glory and of Eternal Light, the Spotless Mirror and Image of God; in Christ, appointed by the Eternal father to be the Judge, Lawgiver and Saviour of men; in Christ, to Whom the Holy Ghost has given testimony; and from Whom are all merit, example, help, grace and reward; In Whom be all our meditation and imitation; in Whom all things are sweet, learned, holy and perfect; in Christ, Who is the light and expectation of the Gentiles, the end of the law, the salvation of God, the father of the world to come, our final hope, Whom God has made our Wisdom and Justice, our Sanctification and Redemption, Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost, co-eternal, consubstantial, and coequal lives and reigns as one God, be everlasting praise, honour, majesty and glory, world without end. Amen.</p>
