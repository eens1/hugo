<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>(69) Our Seraphic Father St Francis, contemplating the most high poverty of Christ, the King of Heaven and earth, Who, at His birth, could not find even a little place at the inn; Who, during His life, lodged like a pilgrim in the houses of others, and Who, at His death, had nowhere to lay His head; reflecting moreover, that in all other things He was most poor, and wishing to imitate Him, commanded the friars in the Rule not to possess anything of their own, so that, unencumbered, like pilgrims of earth and citizens of Heaven, they might run with alacrity of spirit in the way of God. Desiring to imitate in truth this lofty example of Christ, and really to put into practice the Seraphic precept of celestial poverty, we wish it to be understood that we have, in fact, no jurisdiction, ownership, juridical possession, usufruct nor legal use of anything, even of the things we use through necessity.</p>
<p>(70) We ordain that in every Friary an inventory be kept in which an account be give of the more valuable things bestowed upon b us by benefactors for our necessary and simple use. Within the Octave of the feast of our Seraphic Father, every Guardian shall go to the owner of the friary, thank him for the use of it during the past year, and humbly beg him to grant the Friars the use of it for another year. Should he consent, then the Friars may dwell there with a quiet conscience. Should he refuse, then, without any sign of sadness, nay, with a joyful heart, accompanied by divine poverty, let them depart, feeling themselves indebted top their benefactor for the time they were permitted to dwell there, and not offended because it is his property and he is not obliged to offer it to. Thus they shall also do with other valuable things, carrying the articles, such as chalices and similar things, to the benefactor, when this can be conveniently done. They shall, at least, promise to return them should the owner so desire. When the articles can no longer be used, they shall return them to the owners, or ask permission to give the articles to the poor.</p>
<p>(71) We also ordain that when the Friars wish to establish a new friary, they shall first go to the Ordinary of the place, or his Vicar, and ask to open a House in his diocese. When the permission has been obtained, and with his benediction, they shall go to the civic authorities, or to the benefactors, and ask them for a site.</p>
<p>(72) Let the Friars guard against accepting any place with the obligation of retaining it. Should this be demanded, they shall not accept the place without the express protest that they are free to leave whenever this should prove expedient for the pure observance of the Rule. Thus they shall not give scandal when they leave.</p>
<p>(73) And as we ought, like pilgrims and after the example of the Patriarchs of old, live in humble dwellings or huts and quiet places, we exhort the Friars to remember the words of our Seraphic Father in his Testament where he forbids them to accept on any account Churches or Houses built for them, unless they are in keeping with most high poverty. Still less shall the Friars themselves erect, or consent to the erection of, sumptuous buildings. Nor should the Friars in order to please the great ones of this world, displease God, violate the Rule, scandalize their neighbour, and offend against the evangelical poverty they profess. There should be a wide distinction between the palatial residences of the rich and the mean dwellings of poor Mendicants, pilgrims and penitents. It is therefore ordained that no place built by us or by others shall be accepted, nor shall the Friars build, or permit to be built, any House, unless it be in keeping with most holy poverty.</p>
<p>(74) In order to proceed more securely, the Friars shall agree on a small model building according to which they shall build. The cells shall not be more than nine feet in length and width, and ten in height; the doors seven feet high and two and a half feet wide; the dormitory corridor six feet wide. In like manner the other offices shall be small, humble, poor and unpretending, so that everything may preach humility, poverty and contempt of the world. The Churches shall be small, poor and devotional. The preachers shall not desire that our Churches be spacious, for, as St Francis says, we give a better example by preaching in other Churches than in our own, especially if thereby we offend against holy poverty.</p>
<p>(75) To avoid whatever might transgress poverty the Friars are expressly forbidden to interfere with the building except it be to draw the attention of those charged with the management to the simple form of the model, or to offer them manual aid. Let the Friars strive, as far as possible, to use twigs and clay, reeds, tiles and common material, after the example of our Father, and a s a mark of humility and poverty. Let them take as their models the humble dwellings of the poor, and not the modern mansions.</p>
<p>(76) To avoid every disorder, it is ordained that no place be accepted or abandoned, built or destroyed without the permission of the provincial Chapter and the Vicar-General. No Guardian shall make additions or pull down without the permission of the Vicar Provincial who, with a few other competent Friars, shall determine the plan of our Friaries.</p>
<p>(77) In order that seculars may avail themselves of our spiritual services, and that they may assist us in our temporal needs, we ordain that our Friaries shall not be built in places too far removed from cities, towns or villages, nor yet too near them, lest we suffer from too frequent intercourse with seculars. The Friaries shall be, as a rule, a mile and a half distant, always preferring after the example of our venerable Fathers and especially of our own Holy Father, to dwell in solitary and unfrequented places, rather than in pleasurable cities.</p>
<p>(78) it is also prescribed that in our Houses there shall be a modest room with a fire-place, so that, as charity demands and as far as our poverty will allow, we may receive pilgrims and strangers when necessary.</p>
<p>(79) It is also prescribed that wherever convenient there shall be one or two modest cells in the woods or other places consigned to the Friars. The cells shall be somewhat removed from the common dwelling of the Friars and in a solitary place, so that if any Friar desire to lead an eremitic life, when judged fit by his Prelate, he may in peaceful seclusion, and like the angels, surrender himself entirely to God, as the Spirit of God may inspire him. In order that the Friars who are thus in retirement may enjoy God in quiet, it is ordained that the other Friars shall not speak with them except their Spiritual Father who shall provide for them as a mother, according to the pious wish of our Seraphic Father and as we read in the Book of Conformity.</p>
<p>(80) It is further ordained that if in the places the Friars have accepted, there be vines or superfluous trees, they shall not be cut down. With the consent of the owners let them give the fruit to the poor. The vines shall be cultivated, and if they bear fruit, they shall be planted in other places, or be given to the poor.</p>
<p>(81) According to the doctrine of the Gospel, Christians, and therefore much more Friars Minor who have chosen to follow Christ, Supreme Ruler and spotless mirror, more closely in the path of most holy poverty, are bound to remember that their Heavenly Father is able and willing to govern and provide for them. Unlike the heathens, who disbelieve in Divine Providence, they shall not seek with anxious and excessive solicitude to procure the things of this world which the all-bountiful God bestows with generous Hand, even on irrational creatures; but as children of the Eternal father, putting aside all carnal solicitude, they shall trust for everything to the Divine Liberality and abandon themselves to His Infinite Goodness. We, therefore, ordain that no provision shall be made in our Houses, even of such necessaries of life as can be obtained from day to day by begging, except for two or three days, or at the most for a week, according to the needs of times and places. Fruit shall not be stored up except for a short time, according to the judgement of the Provincial.</p>
<p>(82) To preclude the way to excessive provisions, we ordain that no barrels shall be kept in our Houses, but only a few small vessels or flasks. In winter, wood may be supplied for two or three months.</p>
<p>(83) And lest our mendicant state be rich and delicate, lest it be a poverty in name and not in deed, we ordain that, except it be for the sick, the Friars shall not, even during the week preceding Lent, ask alms, such as meat, eggs, cheese, fish, or any other food unbecoming our humble state. Should such things be offered to the Friars, they may accept them provided they do not violate poverty.</p>
<p>(84) Let the Friars beware above all things, lest through the abundance of alms bestowed on them through the favour of the great, the faith of the people, and the devotion of the world, they should become illegitimate sons of St Francis, and forsake their most holy mother poverty. Let them call to mind those beautiful words our Seraphic Father was wont to repeat in transports of love: “I give thanks to God that through His Goodness I have always been faithful to my beloved spouse, Poverty; nor was I ever a robber of alms, because I always accepted less than I needed, so that other poor might not be deprived of their share. To have done otherwise would have been theft before God.”</p>
<p>(85) We further ordain that during a famine the Friars, appointed to this task by their Prelates, shall go in quest for food to succour the poor, after the example of our most devoted Father who showed great compassion for the poor. When an alms was given to him for love of God, he would not accept it save on condition that he be allowed to give it to the poor, should he find one poorer than himself. We read that often , lest he be found without the nuptial and evangelical garment of charity, he would divest himself of his own clothes and give them to the poor, rather than be deprived of the ardent flame of divine love.</p>
<p>(86) Since voluntary poverty possesses nothing, and yet is rich in all things, is happy, has no fear, no desire, and can lose nothing, because its treasure is in the safest keeping, we determine, in order to root out verily and effectively all occasions of proprietorship, that the keys of cells, chests, desks and so forth shall not be kept by any Friar except by the officials who have charge of the things to be dispensed to the community, as is just and reasonable.</p>
<p>(87) And as we possess nothing in this world, no Friar is allowed to give anything to seculars without the permission of the Guardians, who themselves may not give away or permit others to give, save with regard to trifling or valueless things, without the permission of their Vicar Provincial.</p>
<p>(88) To relieve the wants of the sick, as reason dictates, the Rule commands, and fraternal charity requires, we ordain that when any Friar falls sick, the Father Guardian shall immediately appoint a Friar qualified to attend to him in all his needs. Should the invalid require a change of place, this shall be immediately provided for. Let each Friar consider what he would have done for himself in case of sickness. No mother, as our affectionate Father expresses it in the Rule, is so tender and devoted to her only son as each one of ought to be to our spiritual brother.</p>
<p>(89) And since they who are detached from this world find it sweet, just and charitable to die for love of Him Who died for us on the Cross, we ordain that during a plague the Friars shall succour the afflicted according to the regulations of their Vicars. The Vicars, however, shall always have the eye of prudent charity open to such occasions.</p>
