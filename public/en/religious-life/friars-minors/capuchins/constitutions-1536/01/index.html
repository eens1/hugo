<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>(1) In the doctrine of the Gospel, wholly pure, heavenly, supremely perfect and divine, brought down to us from heaven by the most sweet Son of God, and promulgated and preached by Him in word and deed, approved and authenticated by His heavenly Father in the river Jordan and on Mount Thabor, when he declared that “This is My Beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him,” alone teaches and points out the straight path of going to God. Hence, all men, especially all Christians who have professed the Gospel in Baptism, and much more we Friars, are obliged to observe this holy Gospel. St Francis, therefore, in the beginning and end of his Rule, expressly mentions the observance of the Holy Gospel; nay, his Rule is simply the Incarnation of the Gospel. In his Testament he also declares it was revealed to him that he should live according to the manner of the holy Gospel. In order that the Friars may always keep the doctrine and life of our Lord Jesus Christ before the eyes of their mind, and like the saintly Virgin Cecilia always bear the holy Gospel in the interior of their hearts, it is ordained that in honour of the Most Blessed Trinity the four Evangelists be read three times a year, namely, one every month.</p>
<p>(2) And since the Rule of St Francis is like a little mirror in which evangelical perfection is reflected, it is ordained that every Friday in all our Friaries, it be read distinctly, with due reverence and devotion, so that being impressed upon our minds, it may be better observed. Some other pious book shall also be read to the Friars, exhorting them to follow Christ crucified.</p>
<p>(3) In order that the love of God be enkindled in our hearts, the Friars shall always strive to speak of God. Desiring that the evangelical doctrine should bear fruit in our hearts and that all chaff which might suffocate it be extirpated, it is ordained that in no wise shall books that are useless, or frivolous and dangerous to the spirit of Christ, our Lord and God, be kept in our Friaries.</p>
<p>(4) And since the flames of divine love proceed from the light of divine things, it is ordained that some lesson from the Holy Scripture be read, expounding it by means of saintly and devout Doctors. And though the infinite and divine Wisdom be incomprehensible and elevated, still it has humbled itself in Christ, our Saviour, to such an extent, that by means of the pure, simple and unaffected eye of faith, even the simple can understand it. It is forbidden, however, that the Friars read or study anything irrelevant or frivolous. Let them read and study the Holy Scriptures, nay, Christ Jesus, in Whom, according to St Paul, are all treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>(5) And because it was the desire, not only of our Seraphic Father, but of Christ, our redeemer, that the Rule should be observed to the letter, with simplicity and without gloss, as it was observed by our first Fathers, we renounce all privileges and explanations that relax it, detract from its pure observance and wrest it from the pious, just and holy intentions of Christ, our Lord, Who spoke in St Francis. We accept only as a living and authentic commentary thereon, the declarations of the Supreme Pontiffs, and the most holy life, doctrine and example of our Seraphic Father himself.</p>
<p>(6) In order that we, as true and legitimate sons of Jesus Christ our Father and Lord, begotten again by Him in St Francis, may have an abundant share in his inheritance, it is ordained that all observe the Testament made by our Father St Francis when, near death, adorned with the sacred Stigmata, full of fervour and the Holy Ghost, he most ardently desired our salvation; and this we accept as spiritual commentary and gloss of our Rule, because it was written by him to the end that we may in a more Catholic manner observe the Rule we have promised. We are sons of the Seraphic Father so far as we imitate his life and example, for our Saviour said to the Jews: “If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.” Hence, if we are sons of St Francis let us do the works of St Francis. Wherefore, it is ordained that everyone strive to imitate our Father who has given us as Rule, standard and example, nay, even our Lord Jesus Christ in him, not only in his Rule and Testament, but also in his fervent words and holy deeds. For this reason they shall frequently read his life and the lives of his blessed companions.</p>
<p>(7) Our Father, being wholly divine, contemplated God in every creature, especially in man, and more so in the Christian, but above all in the priest, and in a very singular manner in the Supreme Pontiff, who is the Vicar of Christ our Lord on earth and head of the whole Church Militant. He, therefore, wished his Friars, in accordance with the apostolic teaching, to be subject to the divine Majesty in every creature, out of love for Him Who humbled Himself so much for us. Wherefore, he called them Friars Minor in order that they should, not only in their hearts deem themselves inferior to all, but that, being called in the Church Militant to the Marriage-feast of the Most Holy Spouse, Jesus Christ, they should always take the lowest place, in accordance with His counsel and example.</p>
<p>(8) Considering that to be free from subjection to the Ordinaries by privileges and exemptions is not only proximate to pride, but the enemy of the humble subjection of a Friar Minor, and because such liberty very often disturbs peace and begets scandal in the Church of God, and in order to conform ourselves to our humble and crucified Saviour, Who came to serve us, becoming obedient, even unto the bitter death of the Cross, and not being subject to the law yet wished to subject Himself to it by paying the Temple-tax, and finally, to avoid scandal, the General Chapter renounces the privilege of being exempt from Ordinaries. By the highest privilege we accept, with our Seraphic Father, to be subject to all. Furthermore, it is ordained, that all Vicars, each in their own Province, go to their respective Ordinary and Prelates who are members humbly subject to the Supreme Pontiff, the head and superior of all. In their name and in the name of all the Friars let them renounce all contrary privileges and humbly offer obedience and reverence in all divine and canonical matters.</p>
<p>(9) And according to the desire of our Father, we exhort every Friar to treat all priests with due reverence. We further exhort the Friars to obey with all possible reverence all Prelates and the Supreme Pontiff, the Father of all Christians; to be subject even to all human creatures which show us the way to God. Let them remember that the lower the person is whom we obey for the love of Jesus Christ, so much more glorious and pleasing is our obedience in the sight of God.</p>
<p>(10) We further ordain that the Friars be subject, not only to their Vicars, Custodes and Guardians, but that the Vicar General, when elected, will humbly present himself or write to the Very Reverend Father General of the Conventuals, by whom he must be confirmed.</p>
<p>(11) And since to avoid similar privileges our Father St Francis in his Testament commands his Friars that they shall not dare to ask letters from the Roman Court on account of bodily persecution, the General Chapter renounces all privileges which relax the Rule and, enervating the way of the spirit, lay the foundation of a sensual life.</p>
