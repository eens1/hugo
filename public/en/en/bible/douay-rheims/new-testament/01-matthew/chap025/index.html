<h1>Chapter 25</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.</p>
<p>2 And five of them were foolish and five wise.</p>
<p>3 But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them.</p>
<p>4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.</p>
<p>5 And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p>6 And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye forth to meet him.</p>
<p>7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p>8 And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</p>
<p>9 The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p>10 Now whilst they went to buy the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage. And the door was shut.</p>
<p>11 But at last came also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p>12 But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.</p>
<p>13 Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.</p>
<p>14 For even as a man going into a far country called his servants and delivered to them his goods;</p>
<p>15 And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.</p>
<p>16 And he that had received the five talents went his way and traded with the same and gained other five.</p>
<p>17 And in like manner he that had received the two gained other two.</p>
<p>18 But he that had received the one, going his way, digged into the earth and hid his lord&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>19 But after a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them.</p>
<p>20 And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents. Behold I have gained other five over and above.</p>
<p>21 His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p>22 And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me. Behold I have gained other two.</p>
<p>23 His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p>24 But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.</p>
<p>25 And being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the earth. Behold here thou hast that which is thine.</p>
<p>26 And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I have not strewed.</p>
<p>27 Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers: and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</p>
<p>28 Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that hath ten talents.</p>
<p>29 For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.</p>
<p>30 And the unprofitable servant, cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>31 And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.</p>
<p>32 And all nations shall be gathered together before him: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:</p>
<p>33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</p>
<p>34 Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:</p>
<p>36 Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.</p>
<p>37 Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry and fed thee: thirsty and gave thee drink?</p>
<p>38 Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in? Or naked and covered thee?</p>
<p>39 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee?</p>
<p>40 And the king answering shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.</p>
<p>41 Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
<p>42 For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink.</p>
<p>43 I was a stranger and you took me not in: naked and you covered me not: sick and in prison and you did not visit me.</p>
<p>44 Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee?</p>
<p>45 Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen: I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.</p>
<p>46 And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.</p>
