<h1>Chapter 10</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 My soul is weary of my life, I will let go my speech against myself, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p>2 I will say to God: Do not condemn me: tell me why thou judgest me so?</p>
<p>3 Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p>4 Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man seeth?</p>
<p>5 Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men:</p>
<p>6 That thou shouldst inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?</p>
<p>7 And shouldst know that I have done no wicked thing, whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy hand?</p>
<p>8 Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round about, and dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a sudden?</p>
<p>9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and thou wilt bring me into dust</p>
<p>10 Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p>11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh: thou hast put me together with bones and sinews:</p>
<p>12 Thou hast granted me life and mercy, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p>13 Although thou conceal these things in thy heart, yet I know that thou rememberest all things.</p>
<p>14 If I have sinned, and thou hast spared me for an hour: why dost thou not suffer me to be clean from my iniquity?</p>
<p>15 And if I be wicked, woe unto me: and if just, I shall not lift up my head, being filled with affliction and misery.</p>
<p>16 And for pride thou wilt take me as a lioness, and returning, thou tormentest me wonderfully.</p>
<p>17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and multipliest thy wrath upon me, and pains war against me.</p>
<p>18 Why didst thou bring me forth out of the womb? O that I had been consumed, that eye might not see me!</p>
<p>19 I should have been as if I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p>20 Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly? Suffer me, therefore, that I may lament my sorrow a little:</p>
<p>21 Before I go and return no more, to a land that is dark and covered with the mist of death:</p>
<p>22 A land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no order, but everlasting horror dwelleth.</p>
