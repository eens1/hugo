<h1>Chapter 42</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?</p>
<p>2 I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.</p>
<p>3 So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:</p>
<p>4 Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.</p>
<p>5 And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.</p>
<p>6 And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,</p>
<p>7 And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.</p>
<p>8 And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.</p>
<p>9 And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.</p>
<p>10 But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.</p>
<p>11 We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.</p>
<p>12 And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.</p>
<p>13 But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</p>
<p>14 He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.</p>
<p>15 I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.</p>
<p>16 Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.</p>
<p>17 So he put them in prison three days.</p>
<p>18 And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.</p>
<p>19 If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.</p>
<p>20 And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said.</p>
<p>21 And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.</p>
<p>22 And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.</p>
<p>23 And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.</p>
<p>24 And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.</p>
<p>25 And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man&rsquo;s money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.</p>
<p>26 But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.</p>
<p>27 And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack&rsquo;s mouth,</p>
<p>28 And said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?</p>
<p>29 And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:</p>
<p>30 The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.</p>
<p>31 And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.</p>
<p>32 We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.</p>
<p>33 And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways,</p>
<p>34 And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.</p>
<p>35 When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,</p>
<p>36 Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.</p>
<p>37 And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.</p>
<p>38 But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell.</p>
