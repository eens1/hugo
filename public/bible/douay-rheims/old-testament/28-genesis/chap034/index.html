<h1>Chapter 34</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.</p>
<p>2 And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.</p>
<p>3 And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.</p>
<p>4 And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.</p>
<p>5 But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.</p>
<p>6 And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob,</p>
<p>7 Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>8 And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife:</p>
<p>9 And let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.</p>
<p>10 And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.</p>
<p>11 Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:</p>
<p>12 Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.</p>
<p>13 The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their sister:</p>
<p>14 We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.</p>
<p>15 But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:</p>
<p>16 Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:</p>
<p>17 But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.</p>
<p>18 Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:</p>
<p>19 And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required: for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>20 And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:</p>
<p>21 These men are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.</p>
<p>22 One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.</p>
<p>23 And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.</p>
<p>24 And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.</p>
<p>25 And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the men.</p>
<p>26 And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>27 And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.</p>
<p>28 And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.</p>
<p>29 And their children and wives they took captive.</p>
<p>30 And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>31 They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?</p>
