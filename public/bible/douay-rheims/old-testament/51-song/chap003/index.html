<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 In my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, and found him not.</p>
<p>2 I will rise, and will go about the city: in the streets and the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, and I found him not.</p>
<p>3 The watchmen who keep the city, found me: Have you seen him, whom my soul loveth?</p>
<p>4 When I had a little passed by them, I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him: and I will not let him go, till I bring him into my mother&rsquo;s house, and into the chamber of her that bore me.</p>
<p>5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and the harts of the fields, that you stir not up, nor awake my beloved, till she please.</p>
<p>6 Who is she that goeth up by the desert, as a pillar of smoke of aromatical spices, of myrrh, and frankincense, and of all the powders of the perfumer?</p>
<p>7 Behold threescore valiant ones of the most valiant of Israel, surrounded the bed of Solomon?</p>
<p>8 All holding swords, and most expert in war: every man&rsquo;s sword upon his thigh, because of fears in the night.</p>
<p>9 King Solomon hath made him a litter of the wood of Libanus:</p>
<p>10 The pillars thereof he made of silver, the seat of gold, the going up of purple: the midst he covered with charity for the daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>11 Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and see king Solomon in the diadem, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousal, in the day of the joy of his heart.</p>
