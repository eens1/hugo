<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:</p>
<p>2 For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.</p>
<p>3 For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:</p>
<p>4 For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.</p>
<p>5 For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.</p>
<p>6 For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</p>
<p>7 For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.</p>
<p>8 Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.</p>
<p>9 For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.</p>
<p>10 For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.</p>
<p>11 Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.</p>
<p>12 Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.</p>
<p>13 For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</p>
<p>14 For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.</p>
<p>15 For justice is perpetual and immortal.</p>
<p>16 But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend, have fallen away and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.</p>
