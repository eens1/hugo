<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee.</p>
<p>2 I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.</p>
<p>3 To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.</p>
<p>4 Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.</p>
<p>5 The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.</p>
<p>6 The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me.</p>
<p>7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover, my reins also have corrected me even till night.</p>
<p>8 I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.</p>
<p>9 Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p>10 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption.</p>
<p>11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to the end.</p>
