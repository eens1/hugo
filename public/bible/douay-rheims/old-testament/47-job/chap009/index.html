<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified, compared with God.</p>
<p>3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.</p>
<p>4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?</p>
<p>5 Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.</p>
<p>6 Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
<p>7 Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:</p>
<p>8 Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.</p>
<p>9 Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.</p>
<p>10 Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.</p>
<p>11 If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart, I shall not understand.</p>
<p>12 If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?</p>
<p>13 God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.</p>
<p>14 What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?</p>
<p>15 I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p>16 And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.</p>
<p>17 For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.</p>
<p>18 He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.</p>
<p>19 If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.</p>
<p>20 If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.</p>
<p>21 Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.</p>
<p>22 One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.</p>
<p>23 If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.</p>
<p>24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?</p>
<p>25 My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.</p>
<p>26 They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.</p>
<p>27 If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.</p>
<p>28 I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.</p>
<p>29 But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?</p>
<p>30 If I be washed, as it were, with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean:</p>
<p>31 Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me.</p>
<p>32 For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</p>
<p>33 There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.</p>
<p>34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.</p>
<p>35 I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</p>
