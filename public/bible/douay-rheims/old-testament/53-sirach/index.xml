      <description>1 The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned.&#xA;2 My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.</description>

      <description>1 All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.&#xA;2 Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?&#xA;3 Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?</description>

      <description>1 A wise judge shall judge his people, and the government of a prudent man shall be steady.&#xA;2 As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers: and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such also are they that dwell therein.&#xA;3 An unwise king shall be the ruin of his people: and cities shall be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers.</description>

      <description>1 The wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head, and shall make him sit in the midst of great men.&#xA;2 Praise not a man for his beauty, neither despise a man for his look.&#xA;3 The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.&#xA;4 Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.</description>

      <description>1 If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be much thanks for thy good deeds.&#xA;2 Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord.&#xA;3 For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent.</description>

      <description>1 He that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it: and he that hath fellowship with the proud, shall put on pride.&#xA;2 He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honourable than himself. And have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself.&#xA;3 What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken.</description>

      <description>1 Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.&#xA;2 Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.&#xA;3 Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?&#xA;4 He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.</description>

      <description>1 He that feareth God, will do good: and he that possesseth justice, shall lay hold on her,&#xA;2 And she will meet him as an honourable mother, and will receive him as a wife married of a virgin.&#xA;3 With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved.</description>

      <description>1 Rejoice not in ungodly children, if they be multiplied: neither be delighted in them, if the fear of God be not with them.&#xA;2 Trust not to their life, and respect not their labours.&#xA;3 For better is one that feareth God, than a thousand ungodly children.&#xA;4 And it is better to die without children, than to leave ungodly children.&#xA;5 By one that is wise a country shall be inhabited, the tribe of the ungodly shall become desolate.</description>

      <description>1 God created man of the earth, and made him after his own image.&#xA;2 And he turned him into it again, and clothed him with strength according to himself.&#xA;3 He gave him the number of his days and time, and gave him power over all things that are upon the earth.&#xA;4 He put the fear of him upon all flesh, and he had dominion over beasts and fowls.</description>

      <description>1 He that liveth for ever created all things together. God only shall be justified, and he remaineth an invincible king for ever.&#xA;2 Who is able to declare his works?&#xA;3 For who shall search out his glorious acts?&#xA;4 And who shall show forth the power of his majesty? or who shall be able to declare his mercy?&#xA;5 Nothing may be taken away, nor added, neither is it possible to find out the glorious works of God.</description>

      <description>1 A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things, shall fall by little and little.&#xA;2 Wine and women make wise men fall off, and shall rebuke the prudent:&#xA;3 And he that joineth himself to harlots, will be wicked. Rottenness and worms shall inherit him, and he shall be lifted up for a greater example, and his soul shall be taken away out of the number.</description>

      <description>1 Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.&#xA;2 Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.&#xA;3 Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.&#xA;4 Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.</description>

      <description>1 How much better is it to reprove, than to be angry, and not to hinder him that confesseth in prayer.&#xA;2 The lust of an eunuch shall deflour a young maiden:&#xA;3 So is he that by violence executeth of the unwise.&#xA;4 How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so thou shalt escape wilful sin.&#xA;5 There is one that holdeth his peace, that is found wise: and there is another that is hateful, that is bold in speech.</description>

      <description>1 My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more: but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.&#xA;2 Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee.&#xA;3 The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men.&#xA;4 All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no remedy for the wound thereof.</description>

      <description>1 The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone, and all men will speak of his disgrace.&#xA;2 The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen: and every one that toucheth him will shake his hands.&#xA;3 A son ill taught is the confusion of the father: and a foolish daughter shall be to his loss.&#xA;4 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that confoundeth, becometh a disgrace to her father.</description>

      <description>1 O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to their counsel: nor suffer me to fall by them.&#xA;2 Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and that their sins may not appear:&#xA;3 Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?</description>

      <description>1 Through poverty many have sinned: and he that seeketh to be enriched, turneth away his eye.&#xA;2 As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick fast.&#xA;3 Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.&#xA;4 Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.</description>

      <description>1 The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.&#xA;2 The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.&#xA;3 The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man&amp;rsquo;s likeness is before the face of a man.&#xA;4 What can be made clean by the unclean?</description>

      <description>1 He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.&#xA;2 It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity.&#xA;3 And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for sins.&#xA;4 He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.&#xA;5 To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.</description>

      <description>1 Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and behold us, and shew us the light of thy mercies:&#xA;2 And send thy fear upon the nations, that have not sought after thee: that they may know that there is no God beside thee, and that they may shew forth thy wonders.&#xA;3 Lift up thy hand over the strange nations, that they may see thy power.&#xA;4 For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight, so thou shalt be magnified among them in our presence,</description>

      <description>1 Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?&#xA;2 But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.&#xA;3 O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?&#xA;4 There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.</description>

      <description>1 The wise man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, and will be occupied in the prophets.&#xA;2 He will keep the sayings of renowned men, and will enter withal into the subtilties of parables.&#xA;3 He will search out the hidden meanings of proverbs, and will be conversant in the secrets of parables.&#xA;4 He shall serve among great men, and appear before the governor.&#xA;5 He shall pass into strange countries: for he shall try good and evil among men.</description>

As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:&#xA;4 The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.</description>

      <description>1 Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life propped up the house, and in his days fortified the temple.&#xA;2 By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple.&#xA;3 In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.&#xA;4 He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.</description>
