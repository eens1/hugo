<h1>Chapter 34</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.</p>
<p>2 The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.</p>
<p>3 The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man&rsquo;s likeness is before the face of a man.</p>
<p>4 What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?</p>
<p>5 Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:</p>
<p>6 And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.</p>
<p>7 For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.</p>
<p>8 The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.</p>
<p>9 What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.</p>
<p>10 He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.</p>
<p>11 He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.</p>
<p>12 I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.</p>
<p>13 Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.</p>
<p>14 The spirit of those that fear God, is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.</p>
<p>15 For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.</p>
<p>16 He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid: for he is his hope.</p>
<p>17 The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.</p>
<p>18 To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?</p>
<p>19 The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,</p>
<p>20 A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling: he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.</p>
<p>21 The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.</p>
<p>22 The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.</p>
<p>23 The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.</p>
<p>24 He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.</p>
<p>25 The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.</p>
<p>26 He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.</p>
<p>27 He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the laborer of his hire, are brothers.</p>
<p>28 When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?</p>
<p>29 When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?</p>
<p>30 He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?</p>
<p>31 So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?</p>
