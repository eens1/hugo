<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Doth not wisdom cry aloud, and prudence put forth her voice?</p>
<p>2 Standing in the top of the highest places by the way, in the midst of the paths,</p>
<p>3 Beside the gates of the city, in the very doors she speaketh, saying:</p>
<p>4 O ye men, to you I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.</p>
<p>5 O little ones understand subtlety, and ye unwise, take notice.</p>
<p>6 Hear, for I will speak of great things: and my lips shall be opened to preach right things.</p>
<p>7 My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness.</p>
<p>8 All my words are just, there is nothing wicked, nor perverse in them.</p>
<p>9 They are right to them that understand, and just to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p>10 Receive my instruction, and not money: choose knowledge rather than gold.</p>
<p>11 For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to it.</p>
<p>12 I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.</p>
<p>13 The fear of the Lord hateth evil; I hate arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</p>
<p>14 Counsel and equity is mine, prudence is mine, strength is mine.</p>
<p>15 By me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things.</p>
<p>16 By me princes rule, and the mighty decree justice.</p>
<p>17 I love them that love me: and they that in the morning early watch for me, shall find me.</p>
<p>18 With me are riches and glory, glorious riches and justice.</p>
<p>19 For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my blossoms than choice silver.</p>
<p>20 I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>
<p>21 That I may enrich them that love me, and may fill their treasures.</p>
<p>22 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.</p>
<p>23 I was set up from eternity, and of old, before the earth was made.</p>
<p>24 The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived, neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out.</p>
<p>25 The mountains, with their huge bulk, had not as yet been established: before the hills, I was brought forth:</p>
<p>26 He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.</p>
<p>27 When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law, and compass, he enclosed the depths:</p>
<p>28 When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:</p>
<p>29 When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when he balanced the foundations of the earth;</p>
<p>30 I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;</p>
<p>31 Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.</p>
<p>32 Now, therefore, ye children, hear me: blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p>33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p>34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p>35 He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.</p>
<p>36 But he that shall sin against me shall hurt his own soul. All that hate me love death.</p>
