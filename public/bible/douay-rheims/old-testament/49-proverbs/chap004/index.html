<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend, that you may know prudence.</p>
<p>2 I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.</p>
<p>3 For I also was my father&rsquo;s son, tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother:</p>
<p>4 And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live.</p>
<p>5 Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>6 Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee.</p>
<p>7 The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence.</p>
<p>8 Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her.</p>
<p>9 She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown.</p>
<p>10 Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee.</p>
<p>11 I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity:</p>
<p>12 Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.</p>
<p>13 Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life.</p>
<p>14 Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee.</p>
<p>15 Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it.</p>
<p>16 For they sleep not, except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall.</p>
<p>17 They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.</p>
<p>18 But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards, and increaseth even to perfect day.</p>
<p>19 The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall.</p>
<p>20 My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.</p>
<p>21 Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart:</p>
<p>22 For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh.</p>
<p>23 With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it.</p>
<p>24 Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee.</p>
<p>25 Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps.</p>
<p>26 Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established.</p>
<p>27 Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.</p>
