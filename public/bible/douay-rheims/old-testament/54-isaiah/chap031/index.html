<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, trusting in horses, and putting their confidence in chariots, because they are many: and in horsemen, because they are very strong: and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel, and have not sought after the Lord.</p>
<p>2 But he that is the wise one hath brought evil, and hath not removed his words: and he will rise up against the house of the wicked, and against the aid of them that work iniquity.</p>
<p>3 Egypt is man, and not God: and their horses, flesh, and not spirit: and the Lord shall put down his hand, and the helper shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall, and they shall all be confounded together.</p>
<p>4 For thus saith the Lord to me: Like as the lion roareth, and the lions whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of shepherds shall come against him, he will not fear at their voice, nor be afraid of their multitude: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount Sion, and upon the hill thereof.</p>
<p>5 As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem, protecting and delivering, passing over and saving.</p>
<p>6 Return as you had deeply revolted, O children of Israel.</p>
<p>7 For in that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you to sin.</p>
<p>8 And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword not of a man, and the sword not of a man shall devour him, and he shall flee not at the face of the sword, and his young men shall be tributaries.</p>
<p>9 And his strength shall pass away with dread, and his princes fleeing shall be afraid: the Lord hath said it, whose fire is in Sion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>
