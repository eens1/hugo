<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
<p>2 And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. And there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of the beast: and upon them that adored the image thereof.</p>
<p>3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea. And there came blood as it were of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
<p>4 And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of waters. And there was made blood.</p>
<p>5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things.</p>
<p>6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets: and thou hast given them blood to drink. For they are worthy.</p>
<p>7 And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.</p>
<p>8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun. And it was given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire.</p>
<p>9 And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues. Neither did they penance to give him glory.</p>
<p>10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast. And his kingdom became dark: and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</p>
<p>11 And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and wounds: and did not penance for their works.</p>
<p>12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>13 And I saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.</p>
<p>14 For they are the spirits of devils, working signs: and they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle against the great day of the Almighty God.</p>
<p>15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p>
<p>16 And he shall gather them together into a place which in Hebrew is called Armagedon.</p>
<p>17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air. And there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It is done.</p>
<p>18 And there were lightnings and voices and thunders: and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</p>
<p>19 And the great city was divided into three parts: and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.</p>
<p>20 And every island fled away: and the mountains were not found.</p>
<p>21 And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God, for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great.</p>
