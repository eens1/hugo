      <description>1 Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ: to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.&#xA;2 Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord.&#xA;3 As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue.</description>
