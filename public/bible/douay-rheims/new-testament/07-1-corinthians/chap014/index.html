<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.</p>
<p>2 For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.</p>
<p>3 But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.</p>
<p>4 He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</p>
<p>5 And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</p>
<p>6 But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?</p>
<p>7 Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</p>
<p>8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</p>
<p>9 So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.</p>
<p>10 There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.</p>
<p>11 If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.</p>
<p>12 So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.</p>
<p>13 And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.</p>
<p>14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without fruit.</p>
<p>15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.</p>
<p>16 Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou sayest.</p>
<p>17 For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.</p>
<p>18 I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.</p>
<p>19 But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p>20 Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and in sense be perfect.</p>
<p>21 In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.</p>
<p>23 If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?</p>
<p>24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.</p>
<p>25 The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.</p>
<p>26 How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.</p>
<p>27 If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.</p>
<p>28 But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.</p>
<p>29 And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.</p>
<p>30 But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.</p>
<p>31 For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.</p>
<p>32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</p>
<p>33 For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.</p>
<p>34 Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.</p>
<p>35 But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</p>
<p>36 Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?</p>
<p>37 If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p>38 But if any man know not, he shall not be known.</p>
<p>39 Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with tongues.</p>
<p>40 But let all things be done decently and according to order.</p>
