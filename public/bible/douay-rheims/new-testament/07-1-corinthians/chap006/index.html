<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?</p>
<p>2 Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
<p>3 Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?</p>
<p>4 If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.</p>
<p>5 I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?</p>
<p>6 But brother goeth to law with brother: and that before unbelievers.</p>
<p>7 Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
<p>8 But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.</p>
<p>9 Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:</p>
<p>10 Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>11 And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>12 All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
<p>13 Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.</p>
<p>14 Now God hath raised up the Lord and will raise us up also by his power.</p>
<p>15 Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!</p>
<p>16 Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.</p>
<p>17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</p>
<p>18 Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</p>
<p>19 Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God: and you are not your own?</p>
<p>20 For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.</p>
